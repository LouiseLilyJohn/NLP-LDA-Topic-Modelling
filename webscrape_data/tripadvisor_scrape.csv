Celene,1,0,Stellar !!,[5.0],"Stayed Sunday night 20/09/20.The whole experience was magical.Even with Covid changes followed to the max !Beautiful decor,throughout.Fabulous cocktails in the Rivoli bar & the FOOD was delicious.We treated ourselves to the beef Wellington-sublime !The staff are friendly, helpful & discrete.Coming through reception we chanced upon Executive chef Mr. John Williams MBE & head concierge Mr. Michael de Cozar discussing a work issue.I confess to having been overcome at seeing both of these well know people --they stopped discussing what they had to sort out re work and  we had a quick chat about the hotel ,kitchen .Such a lovely gesture ,as all guest's are made to feel that nothing is too much trouble or an inconvenience .Afternoon tea was a delight.Do dress up, wear a tie .The Palm court is there to make you feel special! THANK YOU everyone for a lovely stay ---We will be back !!", September 2020,nan

Bedrooms all to Anti Covid standards and very comfortable and all the staff were attentive but unobtrusive.

Ruby travels,7,4,Afternoon tea treat,[5.0],"To celebrate my friends birthday we went to the Ritz for afternoon tea. We had never been before but had always wanted to so were very much looking forward to it. We were not disappointed!! It was an amazing from the moment we entered until leaving. The hotel is beautiful and the decor is superb. The Palm Court were we were served afternoon tea was stunning. All the staff were very welcoming and nothing was to much trouble. The table was beautifully laid and afternoon tea was superb. The sandwiches were made with a variety of breads and fillings, and the waiter does ask if you would like more sandwiches, but we were happy with what we had already been served. The cakes just melted in your mouth, and you just need to let the waiter know when you are ready for the scones as they are served to you warm, with strawberry conserve and clotted cream. They have many different varieties of tea that you can try. I had the Ritz royal blend which was very nice. There was a pianist playing which was lovely and the whole atmosphere made for a great, relaxed afternoon. As it was my friends birthday I ordered a birthday cake for her when making the booking. It was presented to her at the table and was a lovely end to the tea. We really did enjoy our afternoon and will certainly be booking again and maybe try lunch next time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is thinking of booking this.", August 2020, Travelled with friends
Rachel H,46,39,Everything we hoped for ,[5.0],"We stayed at The Ritz for one night in a Queen room (their standard one) and had afternoon tea and cocktails in the bar in the evening. The welcome when we arrived was wonderful- warm, friendly and professional with some nice touches. The room was gorgeous, champagne in the room and lots of complimentary extras- biscuits, chocolate nibbles, with a gift bag in case you want to take them home. Afternoon tea was gorgeous and the service very slick, piano accompaniment was excellent. Rivoli bar was good and an interesting choice of cocktails. The bed was so very comfy and lovely Asprey toiletries. Breakfast the following morning I’m the main restaurant was excellent and the service too. Overall - great experience, worth the price to see how we might live if we won the lottery (!) and the staff were exceptional and seemed to really enjoy their jobs.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

Jay Walker,5,3,Afternoon tea at the Ritz perfection,[5.0],"This experience was simple perfection. The staff are so friendly and professional: they truly exude a warmth and attentiveness second to none. The food is beautifully presented and tastes absolutely divine. Sitting in the warm pink glow, surrounded by ornate gold, stunning silverware and sumptuous  beauty, eating small pieces of heaven, whilst a piano music filled the air, I honestly felt as if I had stepped into a fairy tale and the real world was suspended for a couple of hours.", September 2020,nan
Paul C,12,10,London’s historic and iconic hotel,[4.0],"My wife and I just stayed at the Ritz London and while it is an amazing hotel it was not perfect. These are tough times for the hotel industry having been closed for months due to the Covid 19 pandemic. The Ritz can’t provide the service that would usually be associated with the Grande Dame, room servicing is not happening as staff can no longer enter rooms so no bed making, turndown service or chocolates on the pillow. So shouldn’t they ensure they excel at what they can do?  We had booked to have lunch at the Secret Garden however we were informed by email that the garden had closed and was now the Italian Garden. Absolutely perfect and no problem, however at check in we were told the Italian Garden was closed due to wind and we were now moved to the Rivoli bar. There honestly was hardly a breath of wind and we did not believe the explanation and guess they weren’t busy enough to open. The Saturday Night Live which we had booked we found out now has no dancers and the dance floor has been removed. We only found out when looking at the website for a dress code but the hotel never informed us. The room was lovely and this may sound picky, but bearing in mind the hotel has been closed for months, the toilet seat was not square and a screw cover was missing from the shaving mirror. We are booked for a return visit on 23 December and are once again booked for Live at the Ritz. Let’s hope it is perfect this time around. Regarding room services, maybe hotels could ask guests whether they would like the room serviced and have them sign a Covid waiver if they do. This is a time to think differently.", September 2020, Travelled with family
WARBZ-X,84,61,Champagne Afternoon Tea,[5.0],"My other half surprised me with a Champagne evening afternoon tea and It was such a lovely experience. I had the gluten free afternoon tea which was the best gluten free I have ever sampled and I’ve had quite a few (I’m a big foodie!). Firstly, the sandwich choices were lovely (something for everyone) and the 3 little cakes were nice but my fave had to be the scones which were so fresh and tasty - I couldn’t believe they were gluten free as they tasted better than normal ones! My other half had the normal afternoon tea and he also thoroughly enjoyed his. After we had our scones the waiter asked if we would like another slice of cake from the stand but we declined as we were so full - that’s very unusual for us as we are big eaters but there was so much food we couldn’t manage anymore but they looked lovely!Champagne was a nice touch also and not dry like most champagnes... very moreish !Finally.... The waiters ... they were very attentive and there were plenty of them on hand to assist.Overall we had a fab experience and would highly recommend.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

Anyway after three attempts to get the Waiter to put more ice in the ice bucket 30 minutes later the champagne was cold.We went to the Ritz because of the TV programme and the Michelin star chef who said the food has got to be right, Well when you get sandwiches with veins gristle and fat inside, I don’t think Keeping your staff in order making mass-produce sandwiches.As for the scones well you should go to Morrisons and get their best scones for for a quid at least they’ve got a lot  of fruit in them as for the Ritz Scones Bland and no fruit. Don’t get me wrong a lot of the food was okay but we did expect better.We received the bill and the waiter said three times are you going to press the tip on the card machine & I said what part of no don’t you understand.As for the Michelin star chef who made our sandwiches probably he be Better fitting tyres.", August 2020,nan

We didn’t have any more which is just as well as we was all stuffed with what we had.For the cake you get a choice of 3, chocolate ganache, Victoria sponge or a traditional fruit cake.

jop694,127,178,Excellent service........ but far too hot in the The Palm Court to enjoy properly!!  ?? Health and safety issue??,[3.0],"Afternoon tea at The Ritz.......This was a huge treat for my family and especially one of my daughters, who was celebrating her 21st birthday that day. We chose the Rose champagne afternoon tea. £76.50 each.The Palm court is beautiful and very elegant and luxurious......and of course old......this is where the problem lay. It was 34+ degrees outside and felt the same inside. The Palm court has a partial glass ceiling and very, very minimal air conditioning, 4 very small vents at the side of the room. I fully appreciate there must be building regulations that restricts the Ritz from installing air conditioning in the room and other public areas but surely a few portable air conditioning units could have been sourced?.. I believe no one would have objected or felt it degraded the room or experience. It was unbearably  hot and uncomfortable and definitely affected our (expensive) experience. The poor staff in full uniform looked uncomfortable but they were being paid to be there....we were paying for the experience!! The Ritz cannot even say it is to do with Covid as they had the 4 small vents already and other public places have air conditioning on. So I would be interested to know why they felt it was acceptable to make paying guests endure  such heat. I think our health and safety may have been compromised?Now the tea... I had emailed prior to our booking as one of my daughters has a gluten and dairy intolerance so I thought this may prove difficult and affect her experience. However I was assured several times she would be catered for.....and she was. An excellent selection  of sandwiches and 4 different cakes plus scones and coconut based cream. She loved it.My other daughter and I requested no mustard or chutney, my daughter also requested no cream cheese, I did not request that, our sandwiches were bland. We were given plain breads and dry fillings. No mayonnaise etc. The ends of the sandwich selection were turning dry and hard possibly due to the heat or maybe because we had to wait 15 minutes passed our booking time of 1.30pm to be seated( though expected to leave  by 3.30pm!!). Not very impressed. My husband who had the ‘normal’ sandwich selection had different breads and mayonnaise. The cakes however were delicious and we could also choose from the cake trolley. The sandwiches and cakes are replenished on request and you can try different teas throughout.The overall experience was special but we came away feeling we paid for where we had the tea rather than the food. It was expensive for the quality of the food overall.....but it was the Ritz and the service was exceptional. Far too hot to enjoy fully. Such a shame as so easily rectified.", August 2020,nan

LissaDEngland,130,59,Sadly disappointing,[3.0],"I booked an afternoon tea as a treat for my  husband's birthday. Firstly I  must say that both the food and service were very good. However, it was an extremely hot day and everyone in the restaurant was fanning themselves with anything to hand so we asked if there was air conditioning and was told that there was but they were not allowed to turn it on because of the danger of spreading Covid. Whilst I appreciate that they are trying to keep their customers as safe as possible it was extremely unpleasant and spoilt our experience.", August 2020, Travelled as a couple
Rivoliballroom,62,19,A touch of class at the Ritz for afternoon tea,[5.0],"Sipping a cup of  Darjeling tea  while the pianist plays 'A nightingale sang in Berkley Square'....it doesn't get much better than this in these Covid times.We were treated like Kings and Queens by the attentive waitors bringing and taking sandwiches and cakes back and forth.The cakes are worth every calorie and the scones were beautifully warm, just how I like them.Its a treat worth doing at least once in your life time...I had called ahead to try and get them to make some seperate dairy free sandwiches as I have an allergy but beware they need 24hr notice according to the lady on the phone.

The tea selection is good and you get a big pot, probably 4 or 5 cups. The sandwiches taste amazing. They will bring more if you like but I’d recommend not to because by the end you will not be able to eat everything. The scones are warm and the jam and clotted cream make them so good to eat. The pastries are so tasty and the presentation is so pretty. Nothing is too much for the staff. It was my wife’s birthday so they brought a  mini birthday cake. Such a surprise.

Mrs_Jamo,26,12,Afternoon Tea,[2.0],"Just watching a programme on TV about High Tea at the Ritz and how the customer is king, can't help but think about how untrue that is given my visit last year.I booked Afternoon Tea for my mother as a Christmas present, I used their online booking system and put my debit card details in so that they could take payment.The afternoon tea itself was very nice. The desserts are almost a work of art and we had a lovely time. We finished and decided to use the ladies room before we left. On  leaving the Ladies room, a staff member approached me and asked me if I had paid. Of course I had, I booked and paid online. This was not satisfactory and I was asked to use my phone to bring up my bank statement. My phone battery was running low, so I ended up the in the kitchen so I could plug my phone into their charger to show payment while my mum waited, embarrassed.  It turns out that they don't automatically take the payment, they just take card details so they can charge if you don't show up etc. Well why not explain that? I thought I had paid, and if I haven't paid, then why not spare my blushes and just take the money from the bank details I provided without having me in the kitchen trying to prove payment?I had to apologise to my Mum on leaving because I felt like I had ruined her experience by not understanding how the payment system worked, and it became something we just don't talk about because we were so embarrassed. It was supposed to be a nice memory for us both, not something we try to forget.", January 2020,nan

I did not stay the night at this hotel, but was mugged out in front of it. FYI to anyone traveling in London, it is common for someone on a bike or motorcycle to come up behind you and snatch your smart phone right out of your hand. Luckily, Terry from the Ritz and one other person who worked at the hotel saw this happen on the hotel's security cameras. They immediately took care of me as though I were a guest. They got me water, juice, whatever else I needed. They made sure I had a phone and a computer to call my banks and cancel the cards I needed to cancel.They called the police, gave us a space to interview in the hotel and even used a house car to get me home safely since I had no credit card or cell phone to call an Uber.The hotel itself was beautiful. Very regal and elegant and perched right on the corner of St. James Park.I know this is an unconventional review, but I really could not have asked for better service from the Ritz and their team.

Both our menus (vegetarian for me) were sublime and well worthy of the Michelin star. My favourite was the pumpkin gnocchi oh baby and the Raspberry coconut souflee quite frankly was like s*x on a plate. Even the toilets are beautiful and the grand piano playing West End hits in the background was just the cherry on the cake.

T_ManAberdeen,35,18,Everything You Think It Will Be,[5.0],"Even although I entitled this review ""Everything You Think It Will Be"", I'd thought otherwise until I actually stayed. That is, I'd seen the pics on this site, looked at the vids on YouTube, and thought it may not be all it's cracked up to be. I was wrong. The images don't do the place justice, and you have to experience it to fully appreciate it.The service is exceptional, the decor beautiful, and I understand why some folks feel like they're in a vintage theme park, but that's the selling point: it's harking back to a bygone era of opulence.There's a dress code, so don't complain if they don't make an exception for you and berate the ""service"" because they failed to appreciate how special you are: it's their house, so it's their rules. Go with it and enjoy it.That said, it wasn't as strict as some have written. I saw a few folks on the Saturday afternoon who weren't exactly suited & booted, and were seated in the lobby enjoying a coffee, but they were still smart (some more so than others). I also saw some folks turned away too, so not too sure what judgement call entry was made on... but if you want to be sure, don't turn up dressed to do the gardening, look like you've made some effort, and you'll be okay.We had stayed two nights, had the Ritz tea first night, dined at the Savoy the second, and had breakfast and room service at the Ritz. It was all fabulous. The price of a cup of tea or coffee in the bar/room may seem high, but you're not just getting a tea - you get the full silver service, and it's worth it. Those that moan about there being no tea making facilities in the room are really missing the point.The full Ritz tea itself is worth every penny, and we were both full by the end of it. There was plenty of sandwiches and cakes offered to us along with tea. The service was excellent, you were made to feel special, and I saw that at every table.The breakfast again, was an experience to be served with liveried waiters. The full English was surprisingly filling, and there was a good choice of fruits and patisseries etc.Room was excellent and turn down service every night. Nothing is too much trouble at the Ritz.And I never experienced any of the alleged rudeness on entering or being challenged by the doorman or staff as where I was going or what I was doing, but again, try and look like you're meant to be in the place. It really isn't that hard.Fantastic place. Has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. I will definitely return.", February 2020,nan

PrC,19,5,"Great Restaurant Staff, but what's going on with weird housekeeping? :(",[4.0],"I absolutely love the Ritz hospitality no matter where I go. I was hoping the same at Ritz london, because it has been a historical and amazing hotel. I was actually disappointed with the housekeeping. We had to ask for basic amenities in the toilet and in the room. When you enter the ritz you expect everything to be made available to you because you are paying a price for the property, the and the acclaimed hospitality, which wasn't up to the mark at all. The best part about my stay was going and having breakfast  at the Ritz Restaurant. But despite mentioning I am vegan, they easily forget that. None the less, the restaurant staff made it up by their beautiful service each morning. The Afternoon Tea service was exceptional. I absolutely loved it. Hands down the best service across the globe for afternoon High Tea.  I could barely even finish my food and my server wanted to keep feeding me it seems (specially catered to my vegan diet). I loved it. I was hoping I was catered to even in the room, similarly (I had better housekeeping service and amenities at The May Fair Hotel and beautiful reception staff, who swayed me there. I expected that from the Ritz, having experienced it in the past. I felt like, I don't know what have I paid for). The reception desk doesn't even smile well, speak so curtly. But the concierge makes up for that. Special shout out to Naval, he was the manager in charge while we were there.", February 2020, Travelled on business

Or you can just sit and relax and have a drink and do some serious people watching!The afternoon tea was delicious. We requested the pescatarian menu which included a good selection of vegetarian and fish finger sandwiches.If you are still hungary you will get a top up of sandwiches. So plenty to eat.I would recommend you inform them of your sandwich choices before the visit. However the restaurant staff will still check and accommodate you on the day too.There was a good selection of mouthwatering cakes and exotic teas to try too.Any other drinks can be ordered if you are not a tea drinker.It was the perfect afternoon and we had a wonderful time.

James Callaghan,1,2,Very Disappointing Visit to The Ritz London,[1.0],After a full day of travel my family and I headed to the Ritz for refreshments as previously my mother and father had been and could not of recommended it more and wanted to share with us the Ritz experience.     As we entered we were immediately made feel unwelcome and looked down upon. As we were directed to what looked to be the bar area we were turned away as I myself was in trainers after a day of travel and to be treated with little respect was disappointing and it put a dampener on our whole trip.     I hope this will not happen to myself or anyone else again and I expect much more in 2020.     We understand there may be a dress code but I would have liked it to have been communicated to us instead of being turned away by a member of staff who spoke loudly and embarrassed all of us.     One positive would be the door man as he was pleasant and courteous as we entered and  PROMPTLY left.I hope to hear a response from management soon., February 2020, Travelled with family

derekcbap,86,15,A truly fabulous stay at The Ritz,[5.0],"We stayed at The Ritz over Valentine’s weekend in order to get engaged and celebrate Valentine’s Day. It was a fairy tale experience for my fiancé and I which began on arrival with an upgrade from our Junior Suite to the Trafalgar Suite at a very reasonable cost. The Trafalgar Suite is the one used in the film Notting Hill where Hugh Grant interviews Julia Roberts, posing as a Reporter with Horse and Hounds. After checking in, we were then taken on a trip through the West End , Buckingham Palace, Whitehall and the back of Downing Street before ending up in Hyde Park near the Princess Diana Memorial, where we disembarked and I popped the question on a bench in a relatively quiet spot. Afterwards we returned to The Ritz where we enjoyed Valentine’s Afternoon Tea in the beautiful Palm Court. This was the best Afternoon Tea ever and commenced with a glass of Ritz Rose champagne. Afterwards we retired to the wonderful Trafalgar Suite before enjoying cocktails at The Rivoli Bar. Residents only can reserve a table in the Rivoli and it is worth doing as the bar can easily get full and booking a table avoids queuing up. We then had a fun evening at The Ritz Club and enjoyed a very dinner at their restaurant. The next day we had breakfast in The Ritz Dining Room and it was, as with virtually everything else, excellent and the cooked English breakfast was superb.In the evening we attended the Saturday Evening Dinner/Dance. The food was sublime and it is a surprise that John Williams has only relatively recently been awarded a Michelin Star as the food was easily 2 star standard. The whole ambience was really special and it was a great experience.Our weekend came to an end after Sunday breakfast (again excellent) and will go down as one of our best trips. In some ways it reminded of our journey on the Orient Express and everyone should try and stay at The Ritz at least once in the lifetime.A icon of course but sophisticated glamour at its best combined with outstanding food and world class service - what’s not to like ?Expensive - yes but it is as good as it gets, wholly recommended", February 2020,nan

We were then spoilt with a choice of tea's, sandwiches, scones and handmade desserts. The service was just brilliant - nothing bad to say, they were all so friendly and made sure we always had enough food and tea. The Champagne was delightful too.

The waiting staff and sommelier (exquisite choices of wine to compliment each course) were second to none and very knowledgeable of their food/wine and were also able to educate us about the history of the building. Then to our delight the live band added that special touch and were accompanied by two dancers that set the stage for diners to get involved. It would have been rude not to join in. Amazing night.

He is absolutely fantastic, pointing out various places on way to ritz. He was so friendly last time , we asked for him again. Just a gem. Check in with robin was fantastic, smooth , friendly and quick.Our rooms were good as expected , although shocked to see painting and decorating being done on our floor. An expensive hotel room to have to walk over paint sheets!I noticed a number of changes that I didn’t see a couple of years back,  staff standing chatting. Not so many welcome backs, something I personally loved. The happy to help attitude has sadly disappeared somewhat. The ritz club receptionist (short dark haired girl) had a slight attitude sadly. It felt like we were an inconvenience to her. The others were nice so made up for her. Just not the level of service we had experienced last visit. Then we found a medical tablet on the desk in our room , can only think it was from a previous guest. Certainly not ours. We handed it in to reception. Then made me think how clean had our room been. Breakfast we noticed the white service gloves had gone. The service was a little slap dash. For example the last time the plates were placed with the ritz logo at top this time just as they came. Not the end of the world but it’s these little things that we thought wow and remembered, the things that made us want to return sadly are no more. The staff speaking to each other again not the last time we were there. It was an okay stay but sadly we expected the same as last time and it just didn’t deliver it. Maybe not the same level of training as before. I have to say we were helped back to the car by very young porter on 8th February at around 4pm.

FourSeasonsElite,39,50,Needs César Back - Huge Upside Potential.,[3.0],"This used to be the key rival to Claridge’s, a cut above the Dorchester and the Savoy. The refurbished rooms are a treat and the bar is excellent, but the rest is strictly for tourists with selfie sticks. Often there’s nobody at the front desk and afternoon tea is merely a slice of Disney escapism these days. The main dining room clings to English formalities that the recently-arrived staff from Europe learn on the job, often in front of you. Nobody was paying attention at the breakfast service. There is no spa to speak of. Trading on past glories and in this post-Brexit era it needs to learn from its sister property, The Ritz Paris, in pretty much every way. Perhaps the issue is salaries in London are so much lower for hoteliers, but that isn’t the guests’ problem. Make it a Four Seasons - like the massive investment in Madrid at their Ritz property - and perhaps it can get back to what it once was in ages past. Location is superb, but the new Peninsula hotel may be extremely strong competition when it opens soon down the road, and regardless, one ought to stick to better propositions available in London at this price point, especially for longer stays.

UKcommuter,85,66,Quintessentially British!,[4.0],"Having stayed here recently to celebrate my partners birthday I felt compelled to provide a review. I will state from the outset that we are just ordinary folk earning a modest wage, therefore I was somewhat reluctant to stay at The Ritz as I feared I'd be judged, but how wrong I was. From the moment you arrive you're treated like royalty! All of the staff we encountered were incredibly kind, non-judgemental and courteous (A special mention to both Michael and the gentleman on the door). Check in was a breeze and we were personally shown to our Queen Superior room, which was located on the 5th floor. I will add the 1930's lifts are very small and cosy, but were readily available when needed. No waiting for a lift at the Ritz. Our room was as expected, 1930's opulence, but with all the mod cons and home comforts of 2020 you'd expect in a five star establishment, including a large TV with Sky movies etc. The queen size bed was exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom was equally as welcoming, albeit slightly tatty in places, but clean and functional nonetheless. A good nights was had. Being a non tea drinker I did find the concept of afternoon tea a bit daunting, not to mention the strict dress code, but I needn't of been concerned. The palm court was exquisite, as was the service. Our food was replaced without being asked and there was plenty of it. However it was very ordinary. My partner, who is somewhat of a tea connoisseur, stated the tea selection was very varied, but like the food no 'WOW' factor.In summary, whilst the service is indeed five star certain elements of the hotel are not. Our bathroom would certainly benefit from a refit and the sandwiches, scones and cakes were average. However you're paying for the privilege to stay at the Ritz and the first class service that lies within and on that front alone it certainly didn't disappoint!", January 2020,nan

But we were quickly aware of the room not being at all sound proofed, we were aware of a lot of noise from upstairs and the corridor.  This didn’t continue through the night but was immediately obvious first thing each morning Overnight there is a lot of street noise, including a loose ‘man hole cover’ or something which you can hear every time a car goes Over it.Clearly no double or protective glazing to dampen the sounds of a very busy London Town.This is not the case in other good hotels in London After dinner(elsewhere)we had drinks in the bar...but it wasn’t particularly special...just a nice bar but for £100 for 4 drinks...I think I’d expect a bit more from the ambience and serviceBreakfast was lovely...but for £84 for 2 of us it should be...and we had to ask for beans, toast, water, hash browns rather than being told what additional options there were.Finally I find it odd that it’s no trainers at all in the public areas after the breakfast service...not much fun having to go to my room and put heels on after 20000 steps round LondonSo all in all...I’m glad we’ve been...but we won’t be back.", January 2020,nan

Don’t expect to go anywhere other than breakfast in trainers, there are dress code police on the door :) you’re not even allowed in the loo ! Great tip is to book a table in the bar if you want predinner drinks, it’s a small bar so if you don’t book, it’s unlikely you’ll get in, useful to know you can only book a table in the bar if you’re a resident.

The location and view from the 6th floor is absolute outstanding, hard to beat! The Ritz is a very classy traditional Mayfair 5-star hotel, with a +100 year history, similar to the Plaza in NYC, and just like the Plaza, it has the same kind of positives and negatives. The architecture and furniture is fitting of a royal castle with lots of marble and gold, the staff/waiters wear morning suits, and the hotel is slightly worn down (even though they continuously renovate it) and the clientele is more or less entirely +70 years. Not surprisingly, the hotel doesn’t have a gym.... However, I sort of new what I got myself into and the Ritz didn’t disappoint.", January 2020, Travelled as a couple

Being in the Ritz for any length of time is like being in a bubble of bliss, charm, luxury and love. The staff in the hotel are full of charm and warmth and inject love in to everything they do. We used both the Rivoli Bar where we enjoyed beautiful cocktails and ate in the Ritz Restaurant opting for the six course surprise menu paired with classic wines. Haven eaten in other top restaurants, the Ritz stood apart for its service. The sommelier and the waiters were exceptionally knowledgable and friendly and created a sense of theatre that I haven’t experienced in other top restaurants like this.

LondonAuntieJ,57,19,Not quite 5 Star,[4.0],"We arrived for our overnight stay a week before Christmas to celebrate my birthday. The hotel was extremely busy but exuded a lovely, festive atmosphere. Our room was fairly large and beautifully in keeping with the period of the hotel. Well equipped but with no tea or coffee making facilities. Robes were hanging in the bathroom but slippers didn’t arrive until turndown. We did have to call down for our bags after waiting quite a while for them.A small birthday cake and card were also there to greet me.We had dinner booked in the restaurant and decided to go down to the bar an hour before for cocktails. However, on arrival into the lounge we were told that the bar and all areas of the lounge were full and we were asked to sit in the foyer and would be called IF a seat became available,even after being told we were residents! If we were not mature or confident people this would have ruined our experience. My husband then went to reception to explain the situation whereby the extremely professional lady agreed this was absolutely not in keeping with the hotels standard and we were whisked away down to a basement bar in “Club Ritz” where the service and surroundings were impeccable.Dinner was lovely but the desserts were the star of the show. The blackberry soufflé was a delight and the Christmas pudding was a buttery and indulgent mound of loveliness. A pianist and singer completed the experience.We finished with cocktails in the bar where the fantastic bar tender was a credit to the hotel. His knowledge and skill were a pleasure to observe... and the cocktails were exceptional.Breakfast the following morning was a huge disappointment. On arrival at the restaurant we were asked to sit and wait for 5 minutes whilst the table was prepared along with all other guests who were also arriving, so the outside lounge resembled some kind of large waiting room. We were then shown to our table where our order was swiftly taken.Our tea and coffee arrived but 45 minutes later there was still no sign of any toast or our breakfast. Hard to believe when there are so many staff buzzing around. We had to ask twice if we could at least have our toast, only to be asked a third time what kind of toast did we order!Guests arriving after us were happily tucking in to their breakfasts when we asked “have we been forgotten?” We were told we had not been and after 1 HOUR it finally arrived!!  It was a basic full English breakfast that wasn’t special in any way and certainly not worth waiting an hour for.Overall we had a lovely stay but for the money it cost, it should be a faultless experience and it sadly wasn’t.", December 2019, Travelled as a couple

It was perfect from start to finish and I loved it. They bought me a glass of champagne in the Rivoli bar when I arrived and was waiting for the room to be ready-gorgeous champagne and a totally ott (in the best way) setting. My room was a suite (of course it was - this was magic time -I hadn’t booked one) and reassuringly comfortable whilst being exactly what I’d expected. They’d made me a birthday cake which was the loveliest, lightest sponge I’ve ever had (apologies to anyone who has ever bought me/made me one in the past). Every member of staff I met was a legend-shout out especially to the guy on the door who remembers everyone’s name and was an aloof free zone. It could have all gone so wrong and been a bit of a nightmare given the ridiculously high expectations I had of the visit ( and, I suppose, the cost), but it was a giddily thrilling (and relaxing-if that isn’t an oxymoron) time and I loved it (& it was worth the money).

Brenda D,239,166,A few disappointing niggles you wouldn't expect from The Ritz...,[3.0],"We booked a one night stay at The Ritz as a Xmas treat. We arrived at 4pm (check in at 3pm) but our room still wasn't ready. Found this unacceptable but it was merely shrugged off by the reception team who gave the excuse that it was Xmas & therefore busy. We were quite shocked at this attitude. Told to wait in the bar but when I asked if there would be a complimentary drink, this was ignored. Not a great start. We were lucky to get a table in the Rivoli Bar on a busy Fri afternoon while we waited for our room.  Enjoyed the choir in the foyer singing Xmas carols - made everything very festive. The tree was also spectacular as were the decorations. The room was nice. I had mentioned that I'd had a special Birthday last month and a small Birthday Cake had been left in the room which was a nice touch. Surprised that no chocolate left on pillow with turn down service. Surely this is a given in every hotel of this calibre (especially given the amount you pay to stay here). It's these little gestures that guests remember and make them want to return. Live at the Ritz is normally only on a Fri & Sat night but in Dec this is also on a Weds & Thurs. We were lucky enough to therefore enjoy the entertainment during dinner having enjoyed a cocktail in the Rivoli bar beforehand. A few mistakes made during dinner with our drinks orders which again you really wouldn't expect to happen at such a Hotel. Also, we were informed that the staff cannot take photos of guests! I was absolutely astounded. No photos of my husband & I at the table - have never heard of such a policy anywhere else in the world! The price for Live at the Ritz is very expensive really for what you get. If you don't want a 3 course meal and wish to order a la carte you must pay a £33 supplement. The Band was average I would say. At the end of the night I was also given a small Birthday cake at the table with a little candle on it and I was very grateful for this! Breakfast the next morning was nice although for a relatively small English Breakfast, it again was hugely expensive (£42 per person). We had to ask for the bill twice having sat there for 15 mins waiting after the first request and it was not overly busy. There were numerous waiting staff in contrast to diners. At checkout we were not even asked if we had enjoyed our stay or if everything had been to our satisfaction. Having stayed at The Burj Al Arab in Dubai  & Ashford castle (Ireland)  in the last 2 months, The Ritz really do need to improve their customer service and listen to these niggles people are mentioning in their reviews. A response would be appreciated from the management to the points I mentioned.", December 2019,nan
St4ple,34,12,"Fabulous hotel, Excellent customer service, beautiful luxurious flamboyant festival decor in public areas however....",[4.0],"I was recently treated to afternoon tea and an overnight stay at The Ritz by my partner.  I had never been to the Ritz before, but like many was aware of its status, and was very much looking forward to our stay there.  Despite arriving early and requesting an early check in,  on several occasions prior to arrival and at arrival at 2pm, due to our afternoon tea being at 3.30 nothing had been actioned and upon arrivalwe were advised that we would be notified as soon as our room was ready but were not called and were only able to check in at the standard check in time of 3pm.  We did note on arrival that others were able to check in early.. We were impressed with the festive decorations and staff who could not do enough to assist us.   Staying at the ‘famous’ Ritz I had certain expectations, as I’m sure anyone would.  Our room was beautiful as I’d expected it would be, but the bathroom was very disappointing, a basic tired and run down suite greeted me with the bath panel warped and flaking paint, not at all what I was expecting, nevertheless the actual bedroom appeared fine.  We changed and went for afternoon tea, which was spectacular and I will review as a separate review. Following afternoon tea, we went back to our room to get ready to go out to the theatre.  At this point we realised that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, a big disappointment for a five star hotel.. upon inspection in the ‘room service menu’ I discovered this was an additional £15... surely this should be as standard in a room costing as much as this?!   I then tried to run a bath and the whole bath tap lever came off in my hands, spraying water out.  I abandoned this and took a shower, again, feeling anything but the luxurious feeling I wanted to feel when staying at ‘The Ritz’.  So then we had an evening at the theatre, and returned to the hotel having a drink in the bar, this was a great experience albeit an expensive one, paying £42 for 1 x vodka and coke and 1 x gin and tonic, but then you kind of expect this at the The Ritz. Going to bed I put the lamp on in the room, only to be met with a strobe effect from the lamp, I’m not entirely sure whether this was safe or not (see pics) but I turned off the bedside lamp and used the main light, but again, not what you would expect from The Ritz.  The bed was spacious and very comfortable and I had a very good nights sleep.  The following morning we had breakfast which was as expected, a wonderful experience, the staff could not do enough for you and the English cooked breakfast was superb. The continental buffet was as expected, full of variety and constantly refreshed with good quality fresh produce. Check out was at 12.00 giving enough time for a lovely lazy morning.  Overall I am a little disappointed with my visit to the Ritz which I imagined would be the ultimate luxurious hotel experience, but just felt too much wasn’t right. For anyone wishing to visit The Ritz,  I would highly recommend the afternoon tea,  but I would not stay overnight. I feel the overnight experience really doesn’t justify the cost and most of what you are paying for is the stays of the name.  I have personally stayed at hotels with far better amenities", December 2019, Travelled as a couple

Gary,22,16,A hotel that is looking after the masses rather than their guests,[2.0],"After waiting for 2 months from booking to finally stay at The Ritz as a 'special treat', we were really disappointed with the overall experience. It's simply a thoroughfare to the public with no consideration for residents.Once checked in we were given a ""tour"" of the hotel which was basically a brief history lesson and an indication where the bar and where dining room was situated.We asked if we could go to the bar for drinks and were informed that we would need to book in advance, also we couldn't book a table for dinner. So basically if you don't book in advance as a resident, you can't visit the bar or have dinner. Don't even think about wanting afternoon tea!We were told if we wanted a drink we would need to go to the casino in the basement, which isn't really what you want to do in The Ritz. Subsequently, we went to a bar across the road where my wife had her phone robbed from our table as we sat having our lunch.The room itself was ok but a bit tired, the decor is lacking.Our breakfasts were somewhat a disgrace for the cost, I'm sure the Premier Inn does a better breakfast minus the fancy silver teapots.My wife ordered a plain omelet and I ordered the full English, after waiting 25 mins our breakfasts arrived, my wife's omelet was just that, an omelet, no garnish, and was overcooked and was like rubber. My full English was 2 rashers of tasteless bacon, 1 sausage, and 2 poached eggs, not even a tomato! The toast was basic supermarket sliced bread, I would have expected nice homemade bread but obviously they are looking at a profit rather than quality.When we were checking out I was asked if we enjoyed our stay, I explained we didn't, and the issues but was simply told: ""it is because it's Christmas time"".So, don't visit during Christmas, if you want to eat, drink or have afternoon tea, book separately as you can't gain access when you spend a fortune staying as a guest.Overall very disappointed that a hugely expensive treat we booked months ago was well below expectations. We've stayed in many hotels for a fraction and received better.", December 2019,nan
Johnthefence,84,39,Yet another amazing stay! ,[5.0],"I seriously cannot speak highly enough of The Ritz, we always have such an amazing time. Normally we visit with our young daughter, but this time just my wife and myself. Normally we are so busy around London we only go to our suite to sleep, but we were able to enjoy the space and relax more this time. All the staff cannot be more polite, helpful and attentive, they all make you feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble. Seriously you must stay here, a lot of people go for just afternoon tea or dinner, but being a guest is amazing. We sat and drank champagne and cocktails in the Rivoli Bar, the staff and drinks here are amazing. We went off for dinner and a show, then returned for more cocktails. In the morning an amazing breakfast awaits, full English cooked to perfection, and a massive selection of continental options. A massive thank you to Ben Dalton for making all our arrangements for us again, also would like to say a special thank you to Fredrica on the front desk, really went above and beyond to help us during our stay.

Leslianne M,25,11,Wonderful!,[5.0],"We have just returned from an overnight stay at the Ritz and to be honest I don't really know where to start on this review.  Our room was spacious with lovely furniture, the hotel itself is stunning and had beautiful Christmas Decorations.  The staff are fantastic - everyone speaks and make sure that you are enjoying your stay - Lorenzo in the restaurant was brilliant and no mention of staff could omit Michael the Head Concierge who is so helpful and so friendly. Dinner is excellent very leisurely and the food is probably the best I have ever had. I read many reviews before our visit and I would like to refute a couple of negative comments - At dinner the portions of food are not huge but are rich and filling with lots of bread and toast on the table for anyone who needs extra.  The breakfast is out of this world - we had cooked breakfast included with our room but to be honest next time I visit I will probably just have the continental - smoked salmon, ham, quiche, eggs, salads, pastries, yoghurt and much more, something for everyone!  You can take photographs but it is The Ritz so be discreet - we took photographs of the main area of the hotel late in the evening when we wouldn't disturb any other guests.Our experience of the Ritz was fabulous in all aspects and we intend to return for another visit.  I would like to thank everyone at the Ritz for making our stay so enjoyable and special", December 2019,nan

beverley,14,3,"Fabulous architecture, fabulous stay",[5.0],"We stayed 2 nights for my birthday in a king deluxe room. The room was small but the decor was fabulous.  The bed was very comfortable and the curtains kept all the light out.  We were on the third floor and I was worried about street noise but you couldn't hear a thing. As the building is old I was concerned that the shower would be poor but I was totally wrong. It was hot and had good power. We had cocktails in the bar and they were gorgeous but a little pricey. We also had afternoon tea which is a must have. You certainly don't leave feeling hungry.  The service throughout the hotel is second to none.  It doesn't matter who you are you are treated like royalty. It's an expensive hotel to stay at but worth every penny.  For special occasions it's one of the best. It's location is ideal for sight seeing around London either on foot or by taxi if you are travelling a little further away. I recommend that you book the restaurant, afternoon tea and cocktail bar as soon as you know you are staying as they all get booked well in advance.  Even mid-week when we stayed.", December 2019,nan
elainesmith2017,14,5,"Blissful, beautiful and beguiling",[5.0],"We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary (40 years).  I booked the dinner, bed and breakfast rate so that we could enjoy the maximum amount of time in the hotel and enjoy dining in the fabulous restaurant.  We also had drinks in the Rivoli Bar.  I have had lunch and tea at The Ritz on a number of occasions over the years but this was the first time we stayed for the night.  When I booked our stay, I was asked if it was a special occasion and, even though I normally would not say, before I could think about it, I did say it was our Ruby Wedding Anniversary.  When we were taken up to our room, to our delight, there was a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice awating us.  How lovely was that!  And, when we went up to bed after dinner on the first night, our bed had been turned down and decorated with red rose petals in the shape of a heart.  Thoughtful and a sweet surprise.Our dinners were from the table d'hote menu rather than the a la carte but even so, our meals  and wines were first class and served with the panache and care you would expect from The Ritz.  Breakfast was excellent with a selection of continental breakfast items with the most perfect raspberries I have seen all year.  My husband enjoyed the cooked breakfasts - well don't most men?!Drinks in the Rivoli Bar were fun because we both love to ""people watch"" and you can certainly see ""toute la monde"" while sipping a G&T or coupe of pink champagne.All in all, I could not fault anything.  You are made to feel important, valued and cossetted from the moment the doorman relieves you of your luggage at the curbside.  All of the staff were delightful and accommodating and willing to help with anything.  Our room, though one of the standard ones, was delightful and the linens, toiletries, etc. what you would expect.  I am planning to return this summer with friends to celebrate an 80th birthday with lunch in the Restaurant and can't wait!  Such a wonderful experience and we adored it all.", October 2019,nan

The entrance was then blocked by what can only be described as a “customer prevention officer” We asked could we have a drink at the bar to which she snapped back “we are fully booked today for residents”, we then asked if there was any where else in the hotel we could get a drink and have a look at the decorations to which she simply replied “absolutely not”That was it - no help no customer service whatsoever.

Alan J,50,97,"Quite good, but not brilliant",[3.0],"Given the eye watering cost of even the most basic room, you would expect everything to be perfect. Sadly this is not the case. No USB charging points. Only one unused three pin sockets you can plug your own charger into. There is a hairdryer provided, but it has quite a short lead and a three pin plug, so you have to unplug your phone charger before using it. It is not near a mirror, though. Premier Inn provide a kettle and teabags, included in the price. Here, you have to pay for it. £15 a day!Still, at least a bastion of the establishment will be able to provide a perfect english breakfast. Or so you would think. You know how the white of a fried egg is all horrible and snotty if its not cooked enough? Yep, thats how it was. Still, the second attempt was perfect.Oh, and if at breakfast time I report that the toilet is not draining when flushed I don’t expect to return at lunchtime to find nothing has happened.  I don’t want to give the impression that the whole stay was dreadful - it wasn’t, far from it. Its just that if you set yourself up to be one of the best hotels in London, and charge accordingly, your clients will expect the best, and will be disappointed when the best is not provided. The Christmas decorations in the public areas were lovely, though.", November 2019, Travelled as a couple
lauren h,35,23,Major Disappointment,[2.0],"Stayed at the Rit for one night at the end of November for our Friends 50th birthday and stayed on the package which included live at the ritz dinner and dance, to say we were disappointed was an understatement. We arrived on Saturday morning and don't get me wrong the hotel with its Christmas decorations was beautiful, we checked in rooms wasn't ready but we were offered a complimentary drink which was lovely. we then went off shopping when we returned are rooms were ready the rooms are very traditional and was lovely. Once we went to the room to get ready for the evening we called down to reserve a table on the bar but couldn't so we thought not to worry we will see if we can get one when we go down. We got ready went down and there was a massive queue to get into the bar we asked the concierge man on the desk he said you have you booked a table and we said no he said well you have to join the queue we then responded well we are paying hotel quest so why should we have to queue with the general public when we are staying at the hotel he couldn't answer the questions and then as we was standing there some people walked up to the desk and was taken straight into the bar and one of them in that party was wearing jeans even after the strict dress code we then said why is that and he said whatever!! he was soo rude..... then the night just got worse... we then decided to go and have a drink in the bar downstairs which is in the casino we then had to sign up as we were non member and then go and retrieve our ID just to be able to have a drink in the casino. We then went to where the Live at the Ritz was being held to get to our table, the room was lovely and lots of people, we then ordered some drinks but they don't do the same drinks as what you have just had in the downstairs bar in the casino. We then waited for a while for our menu due to a table that had came in which had some reality tv celebrities on and they were then taken priority, we ordered our meals and it started off good and then when our 3rd course came out the beef wellington was stone-cold the mushrooms like they had been left out my friends whose birthday it was he ordered the steak which we was paying extra for that came out that was cold it also came with a source and you didn't get the option if you wanted that on the side it just got tipped onto the meal which wasn't wanted it was just a disaster. we then finished in there and decided to go down to the casino to have a drink in the bar as once again we couldn't get into the hotel bar due to not making a booking we went to the casino and then started to have a little flutter and then had to stop as a man came up to my dad and said sorry sir your not allowed to gamble we have to ask you to leave not giving him no reason as to why (even though they are foster carers)!! the way it was done was disgusting didn't even take him to one side everyone was looking at us like we were criminals if you're going to do things like that it needs to be done in a professional manner and you can't turn someone away without a valid reason! So that ended the night. The trip here was a disaster we thought we would try the Ritz as a special treat and to share with friends for a birthday celebration which ended the way it did we had it booked for months and are expectations was crushed. The only best thing was breakfast the next morning the staff in there was lovely and the breakfast was lovely, we were not the only ones complaining when we checked out the following morning. we think the program that came out earlier this year has made people want to visit (which is what made us) and I don't think they can handle the number of guests/members of the public. Such a shame and all we were offered was 15% off one of the 3 rooms we had booked and then as we were leaving a man came out with 2 bottles of the Ritz champagne even though there was 6 guest in 3 different rooms! I won't be staying here again.", November 2019,nan

A warm, polite and very professional welcome from Dean at the entrance who escorted us with commentary and interesting facts about The Ritz to the Rivoli Bar for cocktails and then later into the restaurant. Our waiters Heinrich and Alessandro were exemplary throughout. Superb attention to detail on every course. Heinrich with his descriptions of each and every aspect of the food on our plate to Alessandro’s supreme table side preparation of flambé crepe suzette. Great sounds of the Sinatra era from a very talented band, punctuated by periods of silky piano playing to retain the ambience throughout the evening. The occasional appearance of a classy couple of pro dancers foxtrotting around the floor and musical storytelling with some slick moves made the evening even more special. 5 courses of sumptuous food, exquisitely prepared and delivered over 4 hours with everything that accompanied this event was simply amazing.

The atmosphere the staff create is wonderful. They treat you like royalty and are friendly and polite no matter what your reason for being there. This is the kind of old fashioned dignity and respect that is rare to find these days. The afternoon tea was delicious and the service was second to none. It was more like having a personal Butler than having a waiter. They noticed when your tea needed refreshing and they poured it for you when it was perfectly brewed. Throughout the tea there was wonderful music being gently played on the piano. Our waiter, Yarik (I’m very sorry if I’ve misspelled your name) was wonderful. He said he’d been there for 15 years and he has definitely perfected serving people. He was really kind, courteous and the perfect waiter for our 70th celebration.

She says it's difficult to buy us presents as we have every thing. The day started badly with the parking machines at Havant station not working and a phone call to the ticket office was difficult as we only wanted a one day ticket and you phone for a longer stay ticket so I drove over to the other car park and got a ticket from a machine there. This palava made us miss our train so altered or programme for the afternoon, get you act sorted BR. As our timetable was kicked into touch we were early for our booking so wandered around the shops in the cold and rain until I decided it might be worth asking if we could be seated early. We asked and were sat outside the restaurant in the warm for a while but were able to be seated early as there were just the two of us. A superb room with tail coat suited waiters, really posh, if it wasn't for the need to travel to London we would eat there more often. Our waiter introduced himself and he had a European accent but spoke good English. Unlike the last time we dined there he didn't fully explain the menu and my wife had to ask how was the salmon cooked. That minor irritation over it was faultless and the food and service were sublime, I recommend it. One other thing I liked, as we were seated I took my jacket off but was promptly asked to put it back on, it's great to see somewhere that actually enforces it's dress code.", November 2019,nan

Yvonne K,348,52,Value for money?,[5.0],"The first thing you notice after the warm and friendly welcome from the doormen is the intoxicating aroma as you emerge from the revolving doors. I’ve no idea what it was but it was amazing. Every single member of staff you encounter is not just polite and immaculately dressed, but friendly too. Watch out for the secret door in the ladies where the attendant suddenly appears. The afternoon tea was delicious. Expensive, yes, but you don’t do it every day and it’s worth it for the whole experience, rather than just the food.   We had mentioned a few dietary requirements when booking (you need to if you want to guarantee a table) and they mentioned this immediately and had a separate plate, which was impressive. We had requested no seafood and so were served egg mayo, hummus and red pepper (different), melt in your mouth ham, chicken, cheese and pickle and cucumber and cream cheese. Then there were plain and fruit scones with jam and cream, followed by some beautifully crafted small cakes. We were a little concerned that there were only 3 of each on a table for 4, but we needn’t have worried. More sandwiches were offered, as were more scones and cakes. Then, as if that wasn’t enough, there was a cake trolley offering chocolate cake and rum baba. There is an excellent choice of teas; the passion fruit tea was incredible. So fruity. Or you could spoil yourself with a pink champagne which was, apparently, very nice. Each guest received a large silver teapot, together with extra hot water, so we were very surprised when half way through they were cleared away and fresh ones brought out. What impressed me very much was when the gentleman clearing some pots away inadvertently, for a split second, put his hand inside my glass of complimentary iced lemon water. He didn’t touch the water inside but in an instant he took it away and brought a fresh one. I always try to give credit where it’s due in reviews and will also try and give constructive criticism in a polite way. People are often very quick to complain, but less keen to praise. On the way home we tried our best to think of absolutely anything that was less than perfect. We were stumped. They even gave us a box for leftovers. It isn’t cheap but, in terms of value for money, you certainly get your money’s worth. The highlight, apart from the magnificent building itself?  The extremely talented harpist playing a compilation of music from the musicals, popular tunes and classical. When he struck up Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini it made my visit complete. Thank you for an amazing experience.", November 2019, Travelled with friends

The scones melted in our mouths, still warm from the oven. The ambience of soft golden lighting and opulent decor gave us a feeling of magic. The strict dress code fostered a feeling of glamour and dignity. It was an experience I’ll never forget.

charmainedm,26,2,Bucket List Stay,[3.0],"We stayed at The Ritz in London for a special occasion with a group of friends.It’s such an iconic building with loads of history and centrally located next to Green Park and mist of the West End amenities. The decor was very Art Deco in the main parts and suited the building with stunning views from the main restaurant. The service from all the staff was second to none, apart from breakfast which was painfully slow.We however found it to be a bit lacking as our expectations were high:1. The bedroom furniture was old and scuffed with chips in the paint.2. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room - I would have thought that this is standard in any 5* hotel these days.3. The breakfast was so basic, came late and was cold. The dress code at breakfast was a bit of a joke as there were people in tracksuits that looked like they had slept in it.

We crept down into the casino for a small gamble, which probably was the highlight of the night as it's an amazing place so palatial and classy.

Peter W,26,7,Tea or coffee at the Ritz in London,[5.0],"The best value for money in London is having tea or coffee in the meeting room, which is just beyond reception area in the Ritz Hotel in London. If you need to meet an old friend, or even a business client, the Ritz is elegant and calm, with the finest service. Tea and Coffee are served by uniformed staff on silver metal trays and the china cups and plates complement the solver tea pot or coffee pot, with an additional hot water pot and an elegant sugar pot, together with silver sugar tongs. Its delightful, stylish, perhaps a bit old fashioned but for those of us who appreciate this style of service, it is a very pleasurable experience.

Happy Traveler,81,25,Birthday Lunch,[5.0],"We visited The Ritz for lunch to celebrate both mine and my husbands birthday, we were both so excited to go and it did not disappoint, it’s lovely to dress up and adhere to the dress code, we were on a deal so did think maybe the menu would be limited but it was amazing and we both had a glass of champagne included, The wine list is amazing and rather large so luckily the waiter was able to help us select wines.  The food we had was absolutely delicious what you would expect at a Michelin star restaurant. At the end of our main course I asked the waiter if I would be able to take the menu sheet as it was my birthday, he gave me the whole menu which I thought was a lovely touch and then he appeared with a birthday cake and candle, so sweet, it was packed up in a lovely Ritz box for me to take away, we ate it later and was Devine. The whole experience was memorable and a definite must if you like fine dining, history and to be treated wonderfully.", September 2019, Travelled as a couple
LivermoreGuy,6,2,"Historic, but not comfortable.",[4.0],"The word stuffy comes to the top of mind.  Sure we expected stuffy, it's the Ritz, but we were not prepared for this. We were celebrating our anniversary.  They took the time to beautifully decorate our bed with rose petals.  The room was small but ""Ritzy"" in an old fashioned way.  We had a bottle of Dom to celebrate, we wanted to have it in their bar as the room had no real seating and felt cramped.  Forget paying a corkage fee. They would only allow Ritz Champagne in the bar. One of many rules that are probably for a bygone age.   The tea was underwhelming. I'll give it a very good only from a historic perspective. We've stayed at much more luxurious London hotels for far less money.  If you want to splurge, go to the Savoy.", June 2019,nan

The adults, on the other hand, seemed to be less of a priority. We were there to celebrate a significant birthday and there was no acknowledgement from the hotel of this occasion. The doormen were friendly, the concierge helpful but we found the service, particularly at breakfast, to be average with everyone having their defined roles and not being willing to step outside of them to enhance the customer experience. We also had several issues with housekeeping that shouldn't happen in a hotel of this standard.The rooms are quite dated, for example the Junior suite only had a single vanity when there was room for a double vanity.", September 2019,nan

AaronBCain,28,6,An ideal location for business meetings,[5.0],"In today's world, finding a location for business meetings can be daunting. Is the location accessible? Does the venue provide the facilities needed? Can you guarantee your and your guests security? I know most of you will think of the Ritz as a destination for 'special occasions' or 'once in a lifetime trips'. There you would not be wrong. The organisation is world renowned for very good reasons. However, choosing the Ritz for a recent business trip, with meetings with partner companies, was an incredible experience. The staff at the Ritz all endeavour to safistfy any request that will make your stay more enjoyable. In fact, it seems that the 'impossible' is just a challenge that might take a bit longer. We were able to organise meetings in our room without the awkwardness that can sometimes occur when space is at a premium. The catering staff provided canapes that were everything you would expect from a Ritz experience. Security on entry was unobtrusive, but very thorough.All in all, for business meetings in London, I don't think there is a better location.", September 2019, Travelled on business

Pleasecarrymedaddy,25,36,A grand old Dame,[5.0],"I love staying here despite its showing age. The Ritz is so full of history, character and charm that I find it difficult to say any bad words despite the workers who start renovating the room next door at 7.30 am, singing to radio 1 blasting from the micro speakers of a phone, or two chaps coming in at 10am when you are still in your undies asking your permission to water the orchid on the mantle piece. I stay here as often as I can and will do so in future. It’s my grand old home in London, a relic of a bygone era which I really hope will outlive me. A stay usually starts with your room not being ready, or lost, or a pipe just burst. This is compensated with a swift ushering to the legendary Ritz bar where you will be served that perfect martini or a glass of the fabulous Ritz Champagne. Hey, after all It’s five o’clock somewhere in the world. The staff make this place, they know you better than you think. The front desk always manages to sell me an upgrade to a suite and despite me going in there, determined to resist, I always fail. You know you will spend your money at the Ritz so you might as well go the whole way.  To be fair though, I stayed there recently without a booking as I missed my connecting flight at Heathrow. I must have looked poorly so they gave me the upgrade for free. If I could, I’d move in permanently.", October 2019, Travelled solo

We were able to relax and enjoy our surroundings prior to an exceptional dinner, in one of the loveliest restaurants in London we have dined at. The next morning we enjoyed spending time looking around the nearby famous shops and arcades before returning to the hotel for something The Ritz is justifiably famous for, its afternoon tea, an experience not to be missed.

Everyone was attentive, pleasant and could not be more helpful making the meal a brilliant experience as well as exceptional food.The cocktails and attention in The Rivoli bar was stunning, a great location and although the cocktails were experience it was worth it.Having booked the meal I though ok why not book a room, after wincing at the orice I went for it as a surprise! I have to say I am glad I did the attention of the doorman, front of house staff was great a great experience and beautiful room, clean, comfortable and well maintained. I had said when I confirmed the booking that it was my husbands birthday and the hotel said they would pout a complimentary cake in the room for him. Well it wasnt there when we arrived, but very soon afterwards it was brought to the room. For my husband an unexpected and very kind gesture from the hotel. This was arranged by Elena and was a loveley touch. The Ritz is perhaps not the place we can go to all the time but the attention to detail, kindness of staff and overall experience means we will be doing it agin (when we have saved up!).

We were escorted to out table and our waiter explained the process and was happy to take photographs. The selection of sandwiches and breads were varied, scrumptious and included vegetarian options as per our request. I really liked that the scones were not provided until the sandwiches were consumed, this meant they remained warm. We each had a plain and fruit scone which were mouth watering. The quality of food was excellent. The staff were so attentive, they made you feel so special. I loved the fact that staff at appropriate time poured the tea, without being asked but some how knowing you were ready for another. This was done professionally without being intrusive. As name badges are not worn I cannot mention individual staff but I did thank them personally at the time. The icing on the cake for my friend was when the pianists played ‘happy birthday’ for her.

The (relatively) new Secret Garden is a particular delight and the breakfast is a lovely way to start each day.  One thing was a bit odd, however.  There seems to be a lack of communication about when guests are arriving and checking out.  As a result, I had the maid clean out work documents from the writing desk while I was still a resident, a birthday cake delivered for the next guest with insistence that it was for me, and a turn down service maid arrive to do the room at 9:45pm which was a distinctly odd time to be doing this.

This is tragedy! I noticed that the Ritz dress code is theoretical. Althoug the dress code is ""shorts, trainers and sportswear are not permitted in any of the hotel or Club’s restaurants or bars"", at breakfast in the restaurant some people (hotel guests!) look like beggers wearing creased clothes and worn sport shoes! There is no business center in the hotel! I cannot believe it! If you need to print something personal, the reception staff will read it. There is champagne in the minibar but no champagne glasses. You can drink your champagne in whishy or white wine glassess. Why not! What style and elegance! Some lessons from the Ritz Paris highly recommended. There is no socket in the bathroom for the hairdryer. It's a real pleasure to dry you hair, especially if long, in the room while watching a movie. All these attractions just for £1400 per night!

Eric D,212,59,"Marvelous hotel, but some faults",[4.0],"It had been a dream to stay in this iconic hotel for years and now we finally did it. And I would have loved to give it a 5 star rating, but it's not perfect.Arrival was great. Lovely, and funny!, receptionist top welcome us and check us in. Room was not ready yet, but we were treated to a glass of champagne in the bar while waiting. Quite quickly we were guided to our room. Spacious enough, but a curious lay-out and a bit outdated. The whole hotel is classical (as expected and very beautiful!), but this seemed a bit neglected. The bathroom was nice, except for the shower. It's in/above the bath, which in my opinion is no longer acceptable for a 5 star hotel. Op top of that, the whole bath, and therefore the shower, is very narrow. I don't think I could actually have taken a bath in it and under the shower I was squeezed between the wall and the glass.We left do to some shopping, some of which needed to be altered and could be picked up the next day. But we had better things to do, so the concierge offered to ""send a boy"" to pick up our shopping the next day. Brilliant! Breakfast was a bit light; not a great choice on the buffet, but the surroundings are magical.Which we experienced even better in the evening when we had ""dinner at the Ritz"", which is the most magical dinner we'd had in a long time. Super food, lovely music, professional (dancing) acts, great dance music (real dancing! not disco, house, etc.) and very nice service. All in all a very nice stay and except for the the few flaws a perfect hotel.", August 2019,nan

Formally-dressed staff, every whim satisfied. A staff member carrying four roles of wrapping paper told us he has even bought birthday gifts for guests to give. The outdoor bistro is delightful, the bar exotic and stunning. The breakfast restaurant is gorgeous. Room service is beautifully presented and was available outside the stated hours for us. The Superior Queen room is quite small. We upgraded to an Executive King and were very pleased. Of course, such a fantasy comes with a substantial price tag. And the 100+year-old-building shows some wear. But we could walk many places, instantly get a cab at the front door, or hop on the tube in a few steps.", August 2019,nan

With the Ritz you just have to overlook a little bit of decor ‘tiredness’ here and there, however, I feel it’s excusable due to the traditional style of the hotel. Ritz service is tip top, you will be made to feel like the most important guest in the hotel.

robertparker195,53,13,Amazing afternoon tea,[5.0],We visited with a friend for afternoon tea.  First I must say that the customer care from the initial telephone call to the actual afternoon was excellent.  Probably the most polite and most efficient dealings I have ever had on the phone!  Access for my wheelchair bound wife was available around the back of the hotel and a ramp was produced to enable us access to the tea area.  First table we we put at did not allow my wife to get near enough to the table due to structures under the table.  We were immediately moved to a larger table which was much better but not perfect.  We are used to restaurant tables being either too low to allow wheelchair users to sit correctly or they have cross bars or shelves under the table which again restricts access. (We routinely carry 4 blocks of wood in our car which we take into restaurants and put under the table legs if the table is not high enough!  As we traveled by train we didn't have the blocks with us.  (Not sure what the Ritz staff would have said if we had!!  Food was excellent and a huge choice of teas.  We had lemon verbena which was very refreshing!, August 2019,nan

I like modern hi tech hotels but I make an exception for the Ritz because it's beautiful.  The room was very comfortable and quiet which considering it overlooked Piccadilly was surprising.

Staff have their own personality but it's teetering on the balance of making guests feel a little like their on a conveyor belt so the hotel just need to be careful - that being said we didn't feel rushed and the whole experience whilst formal (jacket and tie required) was comfortable too.

Firstly we went for drinks in the Bar. My wife ordered a Rose champagne and to my complete surprise they served one of my favourite white wines Sancerre by the glass !! The bar is very glamorous and service impeccable. A delightful young waitress served us.Nibbles including olives, nuts and pepper chips were placed on our table and refilled during our stay. At 3.30 we went to the Palm Court for our afternoon tea. There was a harpist playing adjacent to the Palm Court which was very pleasant. We were served in the main by Sebastian who was very pleasant and efficient in his work. Made us feel very welcome. We had pre ordered champagne with our tea. The sandwiches, pastries and scones are served to the table and can be topped up if you require. However there was plenty and we did not need to do this. Any remaining cakes etc are boxed for you to take with you. I had a slice of ginger cake to finish on.We also pre ordered a birthday cake for my wife’s sister. The waiters sang “happy birthday” to everyone in the room who was celebrating a birthday. A very nice touch. There is a menu of the many different varieties of teas you can select. I selected the Ritz Chai which I thoroughly enjoyed. The Palm Court is a beautiful location, decorated to a very high standard. Very comfortable.We chose the Ritz as we believed it to be London’s most iconic hotel and we were not disappointed. We even spoke about how nice it would be to return with our two daughter next Spring.Thank you to all the staff at the Ritz who made our whole experience very very special.

We sat in the secret garden and drank the house champagne. It was lovely.We retired to our room following the drinks as our dinner reservation was for 9 pm. We had booked the dinner and dancing. Right from arrival it is theatrical and brilliant hosting from the staff and singers. The choice of food is to die for. It really is silver service as you could only imagine.All waiting staff introduce themselves personally. We had one disappointment all night only in that the beef Wellington had sold out. This was not a problem as there was plenty of choice.We danced the night away and ate amazing food. We drank amazing wines.We went to bed after all had finished. We made one mistake. We had left our children with parents for the evening. The blinds completely blanked out the light in the room. We did not wake in time for our breakfast.

We were promised a call if the room was early but this did not materialise. Upon arrival it seemed our suite had been ready for ages. We got a complimentary upgrade to a King room which was beautiful. Walking around the hotel its very plush and nice. If you are staying at the hotel you can dress casual.

It's pretty much the same with the cakes, but I would challenge anyone to eat all the cake you are given.Regardless of what you are at the Ritz for, you are welcomed as if you are their main guest that day. We actually went into the bar before our tea and had a couple of cocktails. We had Rivoli Vesper, Cesar Ritz, Extraordinaire & Anne and left £90 lifter, but we felt as the tea was a present, we deserved to spoil ourselves with some lovely cocktails.The Palm Court where you have the tea is very lovely and we were advised by the waiter in the bar to turn up slightly late, as that's always the best way to make an entrance. Along with the sandwiches and cake we also had a birthday cake presented to us with our names on top and when these cakes come out, Happy Birthday is played on the piano, it's so special.

Quinton KR,11,3,A classic hotel and a classic tea,[5.0],"I have always had a very good experience while being there and having tea there.Although I would say that it is true that they are pretty particular about checking you out when you come in to be sure that you are a guest and not just someone coming in off the street. One time a few years ago, my mother, who has been there many times, was walking by with a friend who had never seen the interior and they decided to step in and look around. They were quickly approached by a staff member and asked if he could help them. When my mother replied that she was not staying there and was just in London for the day, the staff member politely informed her that only guest are allowed.  She later laughingly recounted the story as the time she was "" kicked out of the Ritz"". For her, she understood the idea that some places are particular. because the guest who stay there are looking for a place that keeps up a certain decorum that is based on the idea that the guest should have privacy from the outside world, not because of who they are, race, gender, etc, but simply because they are the paying guest. I also walked in once from the street, just to ask about tea and the staff was  very quick to see why I was there, but were very polite about it. I am only recounting my experiences and am not in anyway trying to confute any other guest experiences. However these times are pretty tricky for many upscale hotels to try to keep up certain standards and at the same time not offend anyone or be misunderstood as to their intentions.", September 2018,nan

Bathroom was clean and functional, though shower was smaller than expected.  Service from the staff was extremely prompt and polite, though it was clear they take their dress code standards very seriously.  Concierge deserves particular praise for his quick and effective response at organizing last minute car transport for us when the RideLondon bike event disrupted our prior airport limo arrangements.  Celebratory birthday dinner at the Ritz Restaurant was as grand as anticipated, and we appreciated both the friendly service, and first class cuisine.

Fortunately as it was a deal for two I was able to tag along as the long suffering husband.  We had saved up as having been here for meals a few times in the past, we knew it would cost.Started off by leaving our bags at reception (cant book in until 1500 hrs) and popped in to have a couple of £24 cocktails which were lovely. Staff extremely attentive and I think they appreciated a ""commoner"" in their bar having a giggle. The decor is fantastic.Burst out laughing when some one thought they could flout the dress code and come in with shorts. Following the drinks and free nibbles we had a walk about and killed some time until 1500 hrs and went to book in. As luck would have it our room wasn't ready so we were given an immediate room upgrade and a couple of free cocktails in the bar again. Result.Room was amazing, bed amazing birthday cake and fizz turned up and guess what. They were amazing.The evening meal was, as always, out of this world but the restaurant was, I thought, quite warm especially as you couldn't take your jacket off,  so I had to pop out for some fresh air.Back to our room, and we slept bolt upright as too full. Then came breakfast in our room. I did feel a little uneasy as I was still in bed while someone set out our table and supplied a large English fry up. All in all a great time. I've now got type 2 diabetes but it was worth it.If I had any complaint it would be that there no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms.

Jilliorr,34,31,Horribly RUDE staff!,[1.0],"First of all, I want to be clear that I have never left a negative review on Trip Advisor until now. I review here in order to spread the word about good experiences we've had - but after my brief experience at the Ritz in London I feel compelled to share our disappointment. We were in London for a brief stay with our teenagers. We were not staying at the Ritz, but at a nearby luxury boutique hotel in Mayfair. After dinner one night, we were walking around and saw the Ritz and wanted to take a look. We've stayed at many Ritz Carlton properties and have always been fans of the chain. We walked up to the entrance and were ""greeted"" by a doorman who asked us what we were doing there. A little odd since normally you are welcomed inside, but whatever. My husband replied that we wanted to take a look at the hotel and perhaps have a drink in the bar (Ritz Carltons usually have great lobby bars), the doorman responded with a clipped and cold, ""Lobby's fine."" We were a little confused, but walked in anyway. Once inside, there is a very small area for reception beyond which is the larger lobby area. We started to walk through reception when we were practically shouted at by 3 different people asking us what we were doing and choruses of, ""Can we help you?"" in that way that really means ""What do you think you're doing?"" I should point out that we were all well dressed (husband and son in collared shirts and me and my daughter in dresses). Again, my husband said we just wanted to take a peek in the lobby and maybe have a drink. A man behind the reception desk told us without apology that formal dress was required to enter any other area of the hotel beyond the tiny reception area. Okay, again that seemed strange, but fine - a dress code is  a dress code. So then my husband asked if they had a high tea service (we had done this at nearby Claridges and loved it and were considering doing it again). Just as my husband asked the question another couple walked up to the desk and the man who had been in mid-conversation with us, literally put his finger up to shush my husband as he turned to help the other guests! We were quite literally dumbfounded. I'm not sure if I am doing a good job of explaining just exactly how RUDE this was, but let me tell you, it felt as though we'd been slapped. We were embarrassed in front of our children and treated like dirt - for the mere ""crime"" of wanting to take a look at a hotel. It was horrible. I have no problem with dress codes or making hotel guests a priority, but there were about a thousand other ways the situation could have been handled better. A smile, an apology, an invitation to come back at a later time... any scrap of politeness or professionalism would have been fine - but the people there chose to behave in the most snobbish and rude way possible and it was shameful. As I said, we have always been big fans of the Ritz Carlton brand and their commitment to customer service, so we left disappointed and confused. It made a lot more sense when I realized this is NOT a Ritz Carlton property, it's a partner property, something I did not know at the time, but makes perfect sense now. Not only would we NEVER stay here in the future, but we will tell all our friends as well.", July 2019,nan

From the way we were greeted upon arrival by the doormen to the service by the waiters at our tables, we really were made to feel special and so I think well worth the money. The decor/vibe inside the Palm Court is relaxed and elegant and staff are super attentive. Having chosen our tea option from the menu (coffee is available as an alternative if you ask), we were each brought our own beautiful silver teapot and a trolley stand with a selection of sandwiches/rolls/desserts. These were fresh and tasty and whilst bite size, surprisingly filling. We didn't even manage to finish everything! After politely refusing any further sandwiches, we were then brought warm scones with clotted cream and jam which were delicious! The waiters constantly topped up your teacup and seeing that we hadn't finished ours, offered to box up the remaining desserts to take home (the box itself being a lovely reminder/keepsake to take on the train journey home). Although, there are timed sittings for afternoon tea, we did not feel in any way rushed and had ample time to take lots of photographs (even the ladies restrooms - one of the nicest I have seen!).

We were stopped by what must be security and the woman asked if she could help us. It was the way she asked and the look she gave us that we knew she did not want to help but was actually judging our appearance as if we did not belong in the hotel. This was the first of three such incidents. Each time we were stopped on entering the hotel.

Also a good location for walking in the area as Saville Row and Old Bond Street are minutes away. This was the prefect place to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.

Amits,134,114,Nice,[4.0],Stayed here 3 nights in March earlier this year.   Slightly on the pricey side mostly because of the location and the history involved.  Check was smooth though made me wait for few hours before they gave me a room (check in is 3pm it seems).  The rooms are fairly large by London standards.  Old fashioned but well maintained.  Plug points etc are a challenge given the old architecture but they try.  Breakfast was good but expensive.  Service above average. Concierge was very effective in both theater tickets as well as restaurant reservations.  10% service fee on the price of the ticket however I did not see come and thought was inappropriate for a hotel of this standard.  The least they could do was warn that they would be charging like this.  I have stayed at similar standard hotels in London and have never faced such a fee.  Dint really eat here other than breakfast- very limited vegetarian food.  The high tea  was in a very nice historic room with no windows.  I chose to pass.

This is totally a separate issue from the food waiters  who were all fantastic and the amazing Michelin star chefs who work hard in the kitchen! The executive head chef said we can have a complimentary drink which he told the wine waiter and we didn't receive it as a lovely gesture as we just got married. Didn't expect that treatment from the wine waiter in the purple jacket as I was very polite to him at all time. . I still give 5 stars as why should one person make the night bad and will always want to go back for the best soufflés in the world!, July 2019, Travelled as a couple

The food, service, wine recommendations, lovely presentation of the meal made for a special evening.  The pianist was the perfect compliment.  My only recommendation is that unless you enjoy the sounds of sirens, people partying, and garbage being dumped at 5:30 a.m. every morning, ask for a room away from the street.  Some nights our room was noisy.  Obviously the hotel has no control over police and ambulance sirens.  Our room was large, the bed so comfortable, with every amenity one could need.

Sadly, a few weeks before the visit a fall and a fractured pelvis meant I had to contact the hotel to ask if they could ensure an easy chair and blankets were in the room as sleeping the whole night in a bed was too painful.  To my amazement, I was told this wasn't possible for 'health and safety' reasons!!!  A few stunned emails later, the hotel agreed to the request and upgraded us to a Junior Suite.  In fact, the easy chair never arrived, though the blanket did. (Be warned, the disabled loo on the ground floor is often in use by men who can't be bothered to climb the stairs to the gents - and they don't always leave it in the best of states!) It has been many years since we visited the Ritz and despite its address as Piccadilly, the entrance has now been shifted to a side street which rather spoils the glamour and the glitz.  The front of the hotel is now just a thoroughfare with stands of free newspapers, throngs of commuters and rough sleepers.  The inside of the hotel is beautifully kept and once there you feel the luxury and ambience of wealth.  There are so many staff everywhere you look, some of whom seem to have little purpose other than to look impressive in their uniforms and logos with The Ritz emblazoned.  Customer service is impressive on reception, in the restaurant and in housekeeping.  Our room had a huge bathroom with two sinks, a bath, bidet and walk in shower with lovely fluffy, generous robes and towels.  Housekeeping comes and folds down the bedcovers, puts out slippers etc.  Yet, the rooms are not really luxurious, cosy or memorable.  You could be in any five star hotel really.  Perhaps you have to stay in a more expensive suite to find the exceptional - The Prince of Wales Suite will set you back more than £11,000 a night.  We had drinks in the beautifully appointed Rivoli Bar - well 1 drink a piece as the cheapest glass of wine is £18 for 175 cl and the cheapest cocktail £22.  Dinner in the restaurant is a treat as the room is so beautiful and the various waiters very attentive.  We found the sommelier rather intrusive - we would rather pour our own drinks than have someone constantly replenishing ours.  We had a set menu which we struggled to find anything to eat on.  Disappointing as we'd emailed the list of things we did not eat.  We ended up mixing with the vegetarian menu.  Portions were tiny and very fussy.  The taste was fine but the only food that really delighted were the free appetisers and petit fours.  The main courses were more 'works of art' than a meal.  We did notice that the a la carte diner meals looked awesome and in particular the flambe crepe suzette were clearly a speciality.  People watching is so fascinating that we took nearly four hours for our meal.  The maitre' d at the end asked us whether we had enjoyed our 'experience' and I think that's the point of it all.  It is an experience.  It's not the best food and wine you've ever had (though with options of caviar at £700 a head it may be the most expensive) but it's really memorable.  Breakfast can be had in the room of course from 6.00 am and there are options of Chinese breakfast, Japanese breakfast, Healthy Breakfast all at £45 each.  We only sampled morning tea at £8 a head from Room Service.  (Really, you'd think tea and coffee making facilities would come with the room but there's only an eye wateringly expensive mini bar which we steered clear of.) Breakfast in the restaurant has a buffet and a limited cooked choice (no porridge or kippers for example).  But you can have as much tea/coffee and toast as you like.  Overall, the place is very slick and works like a well-oiled machine (they have five sittings a day of afternoon tea for example so are maximising revenue there!).  I'm glad I went, but it's not worth the money they charge and you wouldn't return - it's simply not special enough.  It lacks the 'wow' factor which really surprised me.  So it's very good, but it's not excellent.", April 2019, Travelled with family

Sheila C,35,298,Much needed break,[5.0],"Wow! I was on a flying visit to London and thought i would treat myself to a stay at the Ritz. Many places of such high esteem often disappoint but this place certainly did not. I've had an exhausting few weeks on my various marches and practically crawled on all floors in to the Ritz i was tired (thankfully i'm used to that position). The staff took great care of me from the second i arrived. And trust me i needed it - when i face bad luck, i really am deep in it. The private jet company with which i have (had) an arrangement managed to screw up my flights and i had to travel with the infamous budget airlines in to London and was sat next to a woman who had indulged in far too many garlicy treats and cheese and crackers and rather made a stink of my journey. I thought eurghhhhh i can't wait to get in to the delightful Ritz where i can put my feet up and chill whilst my London staff wet themselves over the next sacking. Far too many monkeys wanting to reach the top of the tree these days. I brought my friend Carol with me to help her get over the recent loss of her husband (he ran off to Vegas with a younger male). We had a blast! Lovely drinks in the Rivoli Bar followed by a trip to Soho! So kind of the hotel to provide a car. The journey back was not as simple. I lost my stilettos and a couple of diamond rings and carol lost her trousers! The driver was so kind and made plenty of jokes. Even let us stop off for a big mac on the way back. Will try your afternoon tea next time assuming i don't have another sore head! You should also consider padding the headboards in the rooms. Carol was feeling rather desperate and came back with a couple of old timers with plenty of lead in their pencil. Let's just say i heard everything.

There is also a separate cake trolley which tipped me over the edge.

It’s my pleasure to have the most traditional British afternoon tea at the Ritz. However, I have to admit that, comparing with other afternoon tea I tried at Knightsbridge, the taste here is relatively average. But I do love the atmosphere and my surroundings. I very much enjoy the live music and can recall the moment I was seated in the hall. Even the powder room is very fancy and is well-made. High quality service indeed deserves 30% of the bill.

Gareth H,27,8,Pre Honeymoon stay,[4.0],We stayed here as a wedding present from a good friend of ours. It is obviously very posh and the service is exceptional however I would not stay here again.

The surroundings are stunning, such a beautiful setting with the harpist playing to create just the right ambience.  Every detail is considered ensuring parties are seated close enough so conversation and the food can be fully enjoyed.  We were there for a birthday treat and had the champagne afternoon tea. We had opted for a vegetarian platter and there were plenty of sandwiches. The favourite was the one with hummus closely followed by the cheddar and onion chutney. The warm scones with jam and clotted cream are to die for and then the cakes...... For me the shining star of the cakes was the lemon and mint macaron.

Consequently one is not going to get modern fixtures and modern sized bathrooms for example . However I found everything functional and certainly good enough - water pressure was very strong and, if the room could be noisy, there were steel window shutters one could easily shut at night time . Bathrobes and slippers were provided.  The staff were universally great - special mention to the various Irish waiters in the Rivoli Bar ! Concierge service was good and breakfast was very fast service.

Thus, the greater the disappointment to realize that the owners, I believe the Barclay brothers, are not keeping up with investments to turn the hotel into a truly luxurious experience for the 21st century. All the rooms we were shown were noisy, either from noise from busy Piccadilly or from the courtyard ventilation or from the corridor. Not a surprise with old windows that are not up to today‘s standard (towards the courtyard). Also, the water pressure could certainly be improved.

The Ritz is a grand old lady that still answers the needs for a great London hotel that gives you the best of what London is and sets it apart. The rooms and public areas have been lovingly and grandly maintained. This is by no means a “modern” hotel but,rather, celebrates its traditions and the Lindon that has in too many respects disappeared.   The staff of the hotel, and specifically Michael and others at the Hall Porter (concierge most other places in the world) give amazing care and service as though you are a relative in need of guidance and comfort. The Hall Porter at The Ritz is truly a privilege to be assisted by.  We had two rooms for the family and our young boys still enjoy the Ritz Bear they were each gifted with. …", October 2018,nan

Hotel seamed more like a tourist attraction than a luxury 5 star accommodation. Also it seams the more you spend there the better you get treated well that should not be the case all customers should be treated equally! The room bathroom door and tiles were in poor condition for the price you pay for a room these little things should be easily sorted.check out was also very poor stood there for 20mins not one person asked us is we needed help there was 6 computers available and only one girl working. There are much better 5 star hotels in London at a cheaper price look elsewhere will not be staying here again! Oh and it was are anniversary and all they did for that is sprinkle the bed with day old white rose petals witch they have loads left over from the roses they put in all the bathrooms every day!

Mike6258,90,14,Tea at the Ritz again?... probably not,[3.0],"Had tea at the Ritz as a celebration for my wife's birthday.  She had been before several years ago, when she said the experience was very different - more relaxed, quieter, and not so regimented.  This time, the sandwiches and cakes were ok, and we appreciated the recognition of dietary requirements, but I would have preferred a choice of fillings.  And the scones were not the best - doughy and over-salted.  Many of our other grumbles have been mentioned in other reviews.  The closeness of tables; the waiter practically sitting on our macaroons as he served the adjacent guests.  The strict adherence to a timetable - no opportunity to linger at leisure.  The abrupt appearance of the bill - why not sound a klaxon to signify the end of the service - it would have been more subtle.  Couldn't fault the setting or the attentiveness of the waiters, but that wouldn't be enough to justify booking again.", February 2019, Travelled as a couple

And many different celebrations had been had since that time as it was a biggy. The last one was Tea at the Ritz with Champagne. This was an 80th treat from one of our daughters.It was a nice opportunity to be able to dress for the occasion. That is, for me:  suit and tie and for the ladies (my wife and two daughters) dresses, and it seemed that this dress code applied to all the other guests.For such a top class hotel, I was surprised at how friendly and helpful all the staff were, from the commissionaire, Maître d, to waiters and other staff.The Palm Court, which is the venue for the afternoon teas, is a picture of elegance.the tea comprised of cakes, sandwiches, tea, of course and a glass of champagne each. All beautifully presented.As this was a celebration of our combined 80th birthdays, our daughter had arranged for a birthday cake. This little cake with ""Happy 80th birthday"" on it, was brought to the table accompanied by ""Happy Birthday"" from the pianist and clapping from the other guests. A lovely experience altogether.A nice gesture was that any remaining food was packed in a lovely box for you to take home. I was even given a pen as a memento of the visit.A celebration like this is, of course, not going to be low in price, but I would say, it is worth every penny, especially as I wasn't having to pay for it - Ha Ha!", January 2019, Travelled with family

When I did ask for  the tea coffee making facilities I was told I would have to pay for them! Really!!!  Well I did say OK I won't bother, but to be fair the matrade  did sort out a kettle and two cups but nothing else. Strangely there is tea with the mini bar but no milk coffee sugar but you have to pay for the tea.  I went out and bought teabags and milk and made my own  tea. Two days without a cuppa in your room is a long time 😂Maybe they think everybody can afford £20 for a cup of tea in reception. But when it is a Xmas present and treat And you have a budget it's not always the case. I was left feeling if you can't pay you wont get! Shame really! And to be honest I felt like that most of the wk end and that spiolt it for me. Still at least I can say Ive  stayed at the Ritz!

John T,56,22,Putting On,[4.0],"Well what do you expect, decorated with the bling of Buckingham palace.   Opulent and decadent in terms of décor.  Those that work there were, despite being from around the world understood and spoke perfect English and were lovely.   Only slight exception was the rather severe lady at the Casino entrance desk.   On the subject of the Casino we spent until 3:15AM there and I just do not know how the staff put up with our low stake buffoonery for so long with such good grace.   The toilet man was a bit excessive, he opened the door for you, turning on the tap etc. I wanted to go on my own and (at my request) he obliged after my third trip.  There was about twenty of us in a group, therefore I was afforded the opportunity to view other rooms.   Ensure you request a room that has been refurbished.Some of the rooms were very tired on the third floor and had a old cigarette or your nans kind of house smell about them.  I stayed in room 611 and it had just been refurbished to a very high standard, the finishes were impeccable.   Had a junior suite and it was very spacious, something you do not get in newer hotels. Although I spent very little awake time there, my room really, really, really reeked of paint fumes which was not acceptable when you consider the very high end market aimed at. There was a mix up with my luggage, when I got home as I realised I was given someone else's that was identical to mine externally, but they came around my house that evening and swapped it out promptly - full of apologies.

Yes, the youngers choose modernity, they are not ready to surrender to traditions, strict formal dress code, old school etiquette, not ready to accept quite heavy palace style. Does it harm The Ritz? Maybe.   I should say, that all the staff were great, almost impeccable. Special thanks to Concierge team - busy all the time but nevertheless affable and effective.

clairelewis2017,3,6,Not quite what I expected !,[3.0],"Myself and my husband have just returned from a 2 night stay at The Ritz and have very mixed feelings about the hotel. On the one hand it is a very British institution and on first glance looks breathtaking (especially with all the stunning Christmas decorations)  when you add up all the little niggles we know that we would probably not return as there are so many other 5 star hotels to try in London.Although our room was quite grand on further inspection it does appear to be in a very great aunt kind of way, that being a little too much on the old fashioned side. Quite a few scuff marks around the woodwork and a very unspectacular and outdated bathroom. This was an executive room that we booked and we expected something with a bit more wow !The service we received from all of the staff was very good but not in the same league as you would receive at The Goring for example which is much more personal. We arrived at the hotel and carried our own luggage into reception as there was nobody there and although we don't mind doing this as we are certainly not snobbish it is not something you would expect from The Ritz.There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms so you therefore have to request room service if you want a warm drink. £21 for a tea and a coffee is rather expensive when it is your only option for having a drink in your room and you have paid £1000 per night to stay there. When we have stayed at other hotels that do not offer facilities in their rooms ( Le Manoir for example) then tea and coffee are bought to your room complimentary.Our other niggle is that we booked a rate which included breakfast but noticed that you are offered a very different menu to the one that other guests could choose from. There were only 2 options for warm food on the menu, either cooked English breakfast or an omelette. Again not something we were expecting for the amount of money we had paid.  Our final disappointment  was with the lack of public area space for hotel guests to use. We had a very dreary couple of days with the weather and it would have been so nice to sit in a lounge and have either coffee and cake or a cocktail or two but it is near on impossible to get a seat in the Rivoli bar as we found the tables were either reserved or there was a queue of people waiting to be seated. Again in the evening we came down early for a pre-dinner drink but yet again nowhere to sit. This is very disappointing and we feel there really should be a separate lounge bar for staying guests as the hotel is very busy with customers just coming in for either a drink or food who are not actually staying there. There just doesn't seem to be enough space for everyone !On a positive note we did the festive dine at The Ritz one night and thoroughly enjoyed this, the food, service and entertainment were excellent and on our second evening we did the late sitting for the Afternoon Tea which again we could not fault in any way and again the staff were wonderful.I think because we had heard and read such glowing reports about The Ritz we expected it to be almost perfect in every way and although the things we encountered were not dreadful, the fact that there were a few niggles left us feeling slightly underwhelmed and prompted this review.", December 2018, Travelled as a couple

All in all a fabulous experience but if you want reasonable prices this is possibly not for you- £58 each is not cheap but then you can't put a price on the whole Ritz experience.  Do it - even if you only do it once!, October 2018,nan

We popped in on a rainy afternoon just for a coffee - & ended up having a large pot of the most delicious hot chocolate! It was served in a lovely silver coffee pot with real china cups & saucers along with a little plate of yummy shortbread fingers - at no extra cost.   We had a choice of either sitting in the bar or lobby area & we chose the lobby, & sat just in front of where folk were having afternoon teas (which is also very special - have done this before).  Better still, when we came to pay the bill (less than £20 between 2 of us), there wasn't an obligatory gratuity added, which is very rare indeed in London these days!

The bed was so so comfortable. So in all a perfect stay!!! Except, if you are from a country you can claim VAT back, you don‘t get a form for the shopping of their articles.

Well I have to say you don't need a lot as there are five courses and again the taste of the food was amazing. I dread to think how much our daughter paid for the voucher as the drinks were expensive but that's the norm at a restaurant of this calibre and I must say the Charlie was the best we have ever had.

As a single lady staying alone, I was made to feel like a movie star but in such a discreet, gentle and professional way;  and this is their forte - exceptional gracefulness.I only stayed two nights in a Deluxe King - the room was so elegantly decorated and furnished - no it’s not ‘state of the art modern decor’ like so many five star hotels but it’s luxurious, decadent and elegant.  The bathroom was traditional but with wonderful strong water pressure, a separate shower and bath and every little luxury extra one could want. Room service food was beautifully presented and delicious.  I didn’t eat in any of the restaurants sadly.  I was offered the chauffeur service for my onward travels to Eurostar in a stunning hotel Rolls Royce and felt like royalty being driven.Location wise, well I am sure as everyone knows, the hotel is in the perfect central London spot.  Especially lovely that Fortnum & Mason is just a few steps away, Bond Street opposite and Liberty just a brisk walk away.The Grand old Dame of London and I hope this hotel never bows to modernise in a way that causes it to loose that exquisite tradional charm it is world renowned for.

Doormen were so sweet taking photos even though they must get sick of it!  The lobby as you enter was totally WOW, the Rivoli bar was incredibly cool with its art-deco style (small so go early, great cocktail menu) and the bar staff were funny and classy.In the restaurant we sat by the windows and they treated my dad like a king.  Staff were fabulous and also relaxed and charming not stuffy like my dad had feared.They expect men to keep jackets on during dinner which was a bit of a pain when sat in the sun but we respected that the dress code is adhered to.  Watched the lobby staff turn away several visitors who were dressed in ripped designer jeans.  Rightly so!The food was almost a bonus and did not disappoint.  We are used to dining out but for my dad and mum this was really special and they loved the food and presentation.   Dad liked the homemade bread so much they brought him more (twice) and everyone enjoyed the food, felt it was enough, and left satisfied.  I felt portion sizes were perfect.  Less is more when flavor is full on. Every mouthful was an experience.    The roast pork was a delight and I have never had a clear consume.  Imagined it to be totally different but the tomatoes were amazing.  It was my favourite course!Worth every penny and having dined in some lovely places in the past I can honestly say there is nowhere like the Ritz! We intend to return for bar food (i dont think you need a jacket and tie for the bar but still smart wear).  It looked very good.We dined at 12:30 which was perfect.  Bar was quiet and restaurant was calm so we had all the staff fussing around us.   By 2:30 it was full.Must also mention the pianist who was super talented.  It was really lovely background ambiance.   The harpist in the lobby for the afternoon tea area (palm court) was also delightful.

Service is impeccable, from the front desk, concierge desk, housekeeping, doormen, et al.  Special note to the sharp, friendly and knowledgeable bartenders and servers in the Rivoli Bar, a great place to sip champagne or a nurse a cocktail.Mild criticisms?  I find the jacket and tie requirement at the restaurant and tea room  a bit outmoded in today's day and age.  Those seeking out that kind of atmosphere will certainly appreciate it, of course.  Also, upon my late arrival on a Sunday night I was directed by Reception/Concierge Desk to the Casino restaurant as the only available dining option at that hour, but when I arrived shortly thereafter was advised that a private party had taken over the entire facility and my only recourse was room service, which proved a pretty good consolation, I'll admit.", August 2018, Travelled solo

Unfortunately, this one individual was not trained in this aspect of customer care. We had returned from some shopping and were appropriately dressed. As we entered the lobby, my partner greeted this Aryan appearing individual and said “good afternoon.” He responded in a loud and rude manner saying “are you staying with us?” We were shocked by this statement. Other security personnel we had previously encountered were much more diplomatic and would ask if they could be of service. Were we confronted like this because I’m a darker complexion individual or perhaps because we were two men traveling together? This same individual later stared at us again when we were meeting some British friends for tea. This made us very uncomfortable. The rest of our experience at the Ritz was excellent - from the reception desk to concierge services to the doormen.

This stay is no different. The rooms are intentionally dated and completely functional for every facet of modern life. The restaurants in the hotel are superb in every regard and the Afternoon Tea is the experience of a lifetime. Your stay at the Ritz London entitles you to access the Ritz Club below the hotel. The Club is straight out of a Bond film and provides outstanding gambling options and a brilliant smoking lounge, perfect for a cigar and cocktail after a busy day. I cannot say enough about the Ritz London, it is one of my favorite hotels in the world.", May 2018,nan

bluebell961,15,99,Designer footwear not allowed,[1.0],"First off, can’t rate the hotel room experience as we were staying at Claridge’s, but I had to share our experience as I found it completely ridiculous and, honestly, kind of funny. My husband and I fancied a drink after a long day of galleries, museums and walking in the park. We passed by The Ritz and thought we’d stop in. The doormen raised their caps to us, we entered the lobby and a security guard-type figure appeared from behind a pillar to ask us our intentions. We replied we were heading to the bar for glasses of Champagne. He looked us up and down and said we wouldn’t be allowed in due to our “trainers”/sneakers/running shoes.

Everything was plentiful and we were not rushed. We attended the 330pm sitting. Easy access to the Ritz from Green Park station.

The location of this hotel is excellent as well. On the odd occasion we do actually stay over.  On this visit for two nights I was disappointed to note that the cooked breakfast on offer in the restaurant was as limited as when we stayed the last time, over a year ago.  Strangely, the Room Service Menu has more choices.  Why are these Room Service choices not shown on the main breakfast menu?

Upon entering, my husband was immediately stopped, and we were asked if we were guests of the hotel.  We explained that we weren't and that we just wanted to look at their dinner menu.

Everyone was at the exact same moment of their tea as we were - it felt like we were on a conveyor belt rather and it did detract from our enjoyment.  I am a pescatarian so asked for the meat sandwiches to be taken away, the fish and veggie ones kept but instead got a plate of vegetarian sandwiches as I guess they either didn’t listen or I didn’t fit into what was already plated in the kitchen (I had advised of this beforehand).

The food was perfectly cooked and tasted wonderful.  The service was generally attentive although perhaps a little slow after the main course.  Some of the Ritz’s rules are ridiculous in this day and age.

Head man concierge, Michael, took care of our theatre requests - we could not believe that he managed to get us such wonderful seats for the shows we chose - with no notice!  Throughout our visit we were always addressed by our name, acknowledged, greeted warmly and thoroughly spoiled with courteous, professional hospitality.

The Ritz will price match any hotel booking site and add extras so always worth calling their reservations line rather than going online.    The rooms are immaculate, you cannot hear any road noise, the attention superb (although room service not that fast) - and the dining room must be one of the most impressive places to have breakfast.

You started by storing your coats in the cloakroom for which there is no charge just a friendly member of staff. We then got talking to the pianist who was a super chap. How many people must he meet each day and yet he was happy to chat and tell us the various tunes that the clientele enjoy. We requested some Abba and sure enough we heard the Abba medley during our tea. Thank you!The waiters were very polite and took us through the choices available. Again, they were friendly and welcoming without being stuffy. When the sandwiches came we thought they may not be enough but you quickly start to fill up. All are beautifully presented and very tasty. We were offered more and it would have been rude to refuse!Next comes the warmed scones with cream and jam. We had barely started when a trolley was wheel next to the table and we were offered an amazing chocolate gateau or a fresh apple tart. Again, it would have been churlish to ignore such an offer.Our individual tea pots were refilled on several occasions and when we requested the waiter to take a photo he replied, ""Of course. It is my second job!"".When a happy birthday tune started the guests all joined in and gave a gentle round of applause afterwards. How very British.We stayed that long that in the end the waiter pointed out that the next sitting was starting and would we mind finishing so that he could prepare the table. Such a nice way to tell us to leave.Even then we didn't leave the hotel but loitered around the lobby area to admire the amazing bouquets of flowers and take lots of photos.Despite all of the preconceptions and expectations the reality is that Afternoon Tea at The Ritz just has to be experienced and savoured.

Caroline D,1,0,Staff and Location Wonderful - Hotel Area smells like cigar smoke!,[3.0],"Would love to love the Ritz London, but for the price, not worth it.  The Staff are truly wonderful and the location is great.  For some reason, they allow cigar smoking on all of the 3rd floor of the hotel - the smoke wafts throughout the hotel - air quality not good.  Some part of the air system backed up and my room filled with cigar smoke.  I was moved to another room, but would you like to move room at midnight?  The hotel does not cater to business travelers - there is no place to sit and think or do a bit of computer work on the main floor - all of the space is reserved for the tea area/bar.  The rooms are nicely decorated and the color palette is refreshing and relaxing, however, someday soon, they will have to renovate - you can tell that the rugs are put over floors that need repair.The food is great - go to the restaurant.", June 2018, Travelled on business
Iain F,245,73,Afternoon Tea,[5.0],"Had a 1730 sitting and we were absolutely blown away. What a fantastic level of customer service. From being met outside by the lovely man, to being shown to our table inside, opposite the piano. I merely stated my name for my reservation and the experience began. Now I love afternoon tea, I'm a 70 year old woman trapped in a 30 year old man's body in that way. This place is no exception, I don't know how much it cost as I was given this as a 30th present. However the menus state £57ish. I think it's worth it and I'm more Frugal then the age of Austerity.So many choices of teas. Which once chosen is unlimited I do believe. The sandwiches and cakes were v tasty. I managed to plough through two plates of sandwiches, and scones. Then the cake came out, that was amazing. As was the Jam for the scones. Real out of this world flavour as was the tea. My only gripe It's very warm to be wearing a suit jacket for that entire time there should be an invitation to remove it for the men. I understand how it helps maintain the looks but it did feel like torture after a while. The free pen by my waiter was a fantastic cherry on the cake to a fantastic time.

luxor1,37,4,Amazing ,[5.0],"We went as a group of close friends celebrating my 40th before going to the theatre. What luxury. Myself and husband have been to various established places for afternoon tea. This by far was the most amazing one. The variety of tea were outstanding, The Ritz even did some of the not so familiar tea leaves which was nice to see. The waiters were well presented. The music was played on a harp which made the atmosphere so relaxed. I ordered a cake for the group. They way the waiters came out in a formation to all the tables to present the cakes were beautifully done. I cannot praise The Ritz enough and for any one thinking of going- just do it. The experience is worth it.", May 2017, Travelled with friends
truthfulnitpicker,27,11,Unexpectedly wonderful,[4.0],"Upon arriving at the Ritz we were ushered into the reception where the staff were incredibly friendly and efficient. I had heard the staff at the Ritz was stuffy, but nothing could be further than the truth.The suite we had booked looked out over Piccadilly and I was worried about traffic noise but we needn't have bothered. The sound proofing from outside is great. Not so however from above, where we could hear a lengthy hoovering going on and the footsteps of the residents once they'd checked in.The rooms were tired and slightly run down and they seriously need updating and to be given a little more personality. I didn't like the hospital bedding with blankets and sheets,which moved all night and ended up on either one or us, but not both. Maybe I am just too used to comfortable duvets, but it is something they could maybe offer as an option when booking. The beige on beige, on magnolia and the disappointingly decorated bathrooms do not fit with the property (or the cost of the rooms) in my view. We stay in 5 star hotels around the world and one would certainly expect rooms at the Ritz to be far better kitted out to keep up with the competition.There is a balance to be drawn however, because many people go there to re-live the Ritz's heyday and that is part of the charm. Tasteful and sympathetic updating however should be carried out.I didn't like the positioning of the safe which as so low that one had to kneel on the floor to use it; the same with the mini bar, which was rather too mini for a suite of this level of hotel. I was irritated that we had to call room service just for a cup of coffee. In this day and age, they should have Nespresso machines in the rooms and a far better stocked bar. Room service was excellent and the staff cheerful, efficient and polite. The breakfast (full English) that I ordered was delicious, one of the best I've had in years and everything was warm, which often isn't the case. My partner however ordered a Chinese breakfast and he said it was inedible (he's Chinese and so he should know).We had dinner that night and I had forgotten just how wonderful the atmosphere is in the restaurant. With the small three piece band and singer, it was like stepping back in time to those glory days when life was so much more innocent.The food for everyone was absolutely delicious, perfectly served by engaged and attentive, very pleasant waiters.The only downside was that it was my birthday and I nipped out for a cigarette between the main and dessert and the piano player who was supposed (unbeknownst to me) to play Happy Birthday when the cake was delivered to the table, couldn't be bothered to wait for five minutes longer and stormed off. He should be fired for such rudeness, as it was disappointing for my partner who had arranged the whole visit and for me once I had been told of his behaviour. Not good enough!Overall a wonderful experience and we will definitely go back, but the few niggles mentioned really do need to be addressed in my view.Do try it. You will not be disappointed. Lovely place.", May 2018, Travelled as a couple

A beautiful, immaculate building from 1906 with all the old-world charm you'd expect from Ritz - red carpets, fireplaces in the rooms, elegant staff liveries. The service is perfect - very attentive, very personal. You immediately feel the difference between the Ritz and the run-of-the-mill 5-star chains: suddenly you are not in a factory, but in a small establishment that really centers around you. Reception is no stress, very nice people. The location is perfect - ideal for the Buckingham palace, for fashion shopping, for great food.", May 2018,nan

Next you need to dress up. My husband was whisked into a corner and loaned a tie! Yep I almost died laughing! It’s still a standing joke. He was properly dressed even formally dressed but had no tie.

Bathrooms are small, but plenty of hot water with a lot of water pressure. You will not be disappointed.

The decadence of our surroundings, the opulence of the decor is not something normal run of the mill people experience so is great to do. For the uneducated (us!), the hotel holds the Queens Warrant, which means that gentlemen must wear a tie and jacket at all times. If you do turn up under dressed, don’t panic, they have a selection of men’s ties and shirts in the men’s cloakroom. After dressing appropriately for dinner, we were escorted to our table in the main restaurant which was already busy with mainly couples. The food portions aren’t very big but we’re exquisite! I had quail to start and hubby had jersey royals with accompaniments. Our mains were sea trout and chicken. This was washed down with a glass of Barons de Rothschild Reserve Brut included in the voucher. Our desserts were rhubarb mouse and cheese board. At all times during the meal we were entertained by a lady who sang 40’s style songs very expressively and a musical quartet. This all added to the experience of the evening.

Dressed for dinner and joined my companions to find a group of people sitting beside us wearing t-shirts, shaved heads and heavily tattooed with sailors’ language flowing loudly.

When we checked in the receptionist said she could see that we had said we were vegan and that she would be reminding the restaurant and that we should tell them when we arrived to triple check. We did so as we arrived at breakfast and were told to tell our waiter. When we did he said we should have informed them in advance!!! Also that we should tell them on the way out so that they could prepare something for the next morning. When we did this they said that they would get vegan sausages for us.

We stayed in an Executive King room which was gorgeous; traditionally decorated, luxurious and very spacious. It was perfect. The bed was the most comfortable bed we had ever slept in and has now spoiled us for any other bed. The marble bathroom was filled with plenty of towels, luxury toiletries and had a fabulously powerful shower. The robes were so plush and cosy that we ended up buying two to take home with us. The Ritz is a 5 star hotel for a reason and we experienced the very best of it. Lovely little touches like plates of fresh fruit during the afternoon, polishing shoes for us just before we left for a meal, chocolates and a card left for us in our room and sending up candles for a cake we’d brought back to the hotel just added to the wonderful experience of staying in such an elegant and beautiful hotel.

I was surprised to see another dessert trolley come around with chocolate torte cake and Apple slice cake. We had the options to top up sandwiches and pastries.   I think you should allow customers to takeaway their leftovers rather than waste food. I was disappointed that this was not the case. Apart from this small point, I can not fault the experience.

Michael P,3,13,Ticked off the bucket list but not a 5 star experience,[2.0],"I recently visited the Ritz London for the night which included dinner in their restraint and full breakfast the next morning.My wife enjoys high end hotels and so as an occasional treat we spend a night in one and this was on her bucket list.The dinner was lovely and the live band and dancing made for a special experience.Unfortunately the stay in the hotel was disappointing and having stayed in some other 5 star hotels in the UK, this was no way near their level and if you wish for a high end experience this is not the hotel for you. At £720 a night we actually travelled to London the day before and stayed locally so we could arrive promptly t the 15.00 (the check in time) and enjoy the full experience. We arrived to find our room to our surprise was not ready and were lead to the bar and paid for our drinks whilst we waited an hour for it to be prepared. I had to enquire several times before just over an hour later we were shown to our room.On arriving at the hotel we were asked if this was a special occasion we explained we were celebrating an anniversary. When we arrived in our room I saw a card and thought this was a nice touch, until I noted it was addressed to someone else.Having waited to get into our room, we were keen to get ready for dinner but had to wait another hour before it became apparent that our luggage was not arriving requiring me to chase this again.My wife decided to have a bath whilst waiting, to find there was no hot water and having waited to get into our room and for our luggage we decided not to request a change at this time. The problems with the bathroom continued as we discovered the toilet was blocked.I fed this back to the Ritz who have offered me a free drink at their bar should I ever visit again. I will let readers decide whether they think that is adequate acknowledgment of the multiple errors that occurred.At the end of the day all the details described above may seem small and if one was staying in a budget hotel one may just mention them in passing but given the price of this establishment one would expect far better service. If like us this is on your bucket list then visit and enjoy the lovely decor and good food (the restaurant is superb) and tick it off, but if you want a 5 star stay then there are some top quality establishments around that are on another level. The Milestone for example is a whole other level in service and detail. My advice: if it is on your bucket list then visit for fantastic dinner and enjoy the live entertainment and atmosphere at a weekend but stay somewhere else as the hotel service is left wanting.", March 2018, Travelled as a couple

latetedelacuvee,116,55,Small fish: I won’t be missed,[1.0],"Dear General Manager, Mr. Gowili,My recent experience at the Ritz in London was a shock, to say the least. Perhaps it is time for some staff training. I came to the London Ritz on 1 March, a very snowy and cold day, in search of a good drink and perhaps a meal. With more than 40 years of positive experience at Ritzs around the world, I was looking forward to the visit. The Ritz was there at key points in my life, including my first visit to the Boston Ritz in the 1970s with my grandmother who put the Ritz in the category of “institutions of quality” in town. It wasn’t that it was the fanciest hotel (although it was), but like the best among them, great and small, it represented a high quality experience and real people who were attuned to the needs of guests. My feelings for the London Ritz were positive. It has been a favoured location for business meetings over tea or cocktails, when I have travelled to London. The service has always been excellent, although a bit stiff.Alas, my arrival in London on a snowy day after cancelled flights and lost baggage resulted in arrival in the city, exhausted and a looking forward for a good drink in a civilised place. My wife and I pulled in off the slushy streets—in sneakers, khaki pants, and a black fleece—looking forward to the warmth and shelter of the Ritz. Greeted warmly by the doorman, we passed reception when we were stopped by a woman.Her: “Where are you going” Me: “We are going to the bar for a drink and some food. “Her: “Are you a guest at the hotel?”Me: “No”Her: “You cannot enter, there is a dress code” As she looked me up and down and finally her eyes met my sneakersHer: “sneakers are not allowed”Me: “I’m sorry, but our bags were lost and these are the only clothes we have”Her: “you cannot enter”Of course, my wife and I were offended and we left for one of the other great spots in Mayfair.Ironically, as we were being scrutinised, at least two people passed into the hallway area, where the bar and sitting areas are located, wearing things that made us look positively upscale. Not only sneakers, but jeans (I have no problem with them, but it seems our hostess was more than discriminating, she was discriminatory). Times have changed and people are not always as one might think. We are more than our suits, or so I thought. But not at the Ritz. Indeed, one of the first best lessons of my life came from the doorman at the Boston Ritz who told me when you “assume” you make a sass of U and ME. He was right.It seems the some of the London Ritz staff missed that training session. You won’t miss my business, I’m a small fish.

RoySharma,58,18,Quite a Reputation - well deserved,[5.0],"Birthday celebration - we went for afternoon tea and stayed overnight.  Very courteous and helpful staff made us comfortable in the bar as we were a bit early for the room.  Top class cocktails and nibbles followed by a stunning afternoon tea. They had the knack of not presenting you with too much - but there was always more coming to try and taste.  Unexpected cake delivered to our room - wonderful touch.  The room was a mix of stately home, opulence and high tech - easily the fastest WiFi matched with a huge, luxurious bed in a superbly appointed room.  Great lighting - from moody to bright enough to work - very well done.  Instant hot water in the bathrooms - great bath and shower.  Breakfast was again a very high standard - could I quibble?  Possibly - a choice of white or brown toast was there - but I missed some of the artisan breads and toasts that some of the others offer.  Very minor point.

The staff couldn't be more helpful or kind and courteous. After settling in to our room, which was simply opulant, we spent a couple of hours having tea, watching the world go by, just enjoying the moment. We didnt eat there in the evening so I can only imagine. However if breakfast is anything to go by then I'm sure it's fantastic.I had the traditional english breakfast and the wife went continental. Blown away. The best ever, loved the sausage and tomatoes. Devine.You never feel rushed here, a really relaxing enviroment to spend some time. Wish it had been longer.

Oh my, we’re we amazed, as the interior was beautiful and breathtaking.  There was a lot to admire and take in.Anyway, our coats were taken and put away safely when were were seated near the large windows (lovely), we were served by 2 waiters one of which was called Philipo. He and the other gentleman were very professional, friendly and curtious (thank you).  We were made to feel welcomed all the way through. They explained things to us and were attentive.The dishes selected were beautifully presented, very tasteful and just right when we completed all the different parts...after the dessert we also has a lovely tray of sweets beautifully made and delicious...and cannot forget the champagne!My mother Emily was overwhelmed by it all and was treated like a queen and I felt like a princess.

Red E,48,67,High Expectations - needs improvement,[3.0],"Four of us (two couples) had afternoon tea to celebrate a 65th birthday and also stayed overnight as part of the celebration.  When we booked afternoon tea we were advised that any dietary requirements could be catered for.  I emailed our dietary requirements in advance, one of which was for wholemeal scones as opposed to white scones.  We have had wholemeal scones in many other places but surprisingly The Ritz called me advising the pastry chef could not provide wholemeal scones !! Otherwise afternoon tea was superb if a tad busy. We were offered repeat sandwiches all of which were made to meet our specific requirements. The coconut macaroons were to die for !  We had a few drinks in the Rivoli bar that evening. The bar is classy, alas the staff less so.  They were clearly talking about us in a derogatory way. When they realised we were actually staying at the hotel, their attitude changed in an instant and they were much more attentive.  Check in was fabulous, the reception staff were delightful. The room was a lovely size, bathroom less so but the toiletries, slippers and bathrobes were superior. Breakfast had a good choice although not spectacular.  We did have high expectations but The Ritz is a pricey, well established luxury hotel.  My husband said the vegetarian sausages were the best he'd ever had.  However the bread selection was VERY disappointing.  There were only hard brown or white rolls on the buffet and the toast was sliced bread similar to that sold in a supermarket.  Breakfast is around £40 per head so it needs to be much improved.  Coffee rating - average.", February 2018, Travelled as a couple

People worry about the snobbery issue but this was not in evidence with the hotel or staff, maybe a few of our fellow tea drinkers had an air of snobbery but you could see it was false. One thing I did notice was a young man came in in black jeans with ripped knees this didn't show until he sat down ,the dress code seems more towards men rather than ladies which I feel should be addressed.

lexluthor10,12,48,Stay here if you like snooty Doormen/Staff rejecting paying customers,[1.0],"Stayed here as a guest for 3 nights during February 2018 with my girlfriend and had a terrible experience. For starters, the staff were incredibly rude, snooty and snobbish to the point of ridiculous.Despite spending thousands of dollars to stay at the hotel, we actually had doormen refusing to open the door for us to get to the corridor to access the lift to our very very expensive room that we were paying for.I guess they couldn't believe that 2 people under the age of 30 could afford to stay at this overpriced dump? Despite complaining to management about this experience, we still had staff and other ""doormen"" questioning us numerous times after when we returned to the hotel as to whether we were actually staying at the hotel.  After 5 or so times, it can get very infuriating - especially if it is an employee you have already spoken to! Even after 4 days of coming and going through the hotel we were asked upon entry if we were actually staying at the hotel!!Despite wearing a $1000 Burberry scarf, a $30,000 watch, and dressing completely professionally, the staff here clearly felt we weren't good enough to be there, in my view. Furthermore, I've stayed in numerous 5 star hotels, and honestly I don't think this cuts it. The room felt tired and worn and lacked basic amenities like a coffee/kettle/and cable TV channels. The bathroom felt like it was from the 1920s with old taps and a tiny shower and bath.The breakfast was below average with poached eggs that weren't actually poached, no relishes other than ""tomato sauce"", cold dry toast, and little variety. Honestly, the food seemed like it was from the Great Depression.Perhaps this place was good in the early 1900's, but it is now resting solely on it's laurels and it's name.  I recommend staying at the Sofitel in St James instead. They will gladly welcome you back the hotel each time and greet you by your name, and not interrogate you like aggressive nightclub bouncers.", February 2018, Travelled as a couple

We were greeted by Luisa who had such a lovely manner and was really engaging with our three-year-old - showing him how - as a VIK (Very Important Kid) - he could get free and unlimited ice cream whenever he wanted. His ears certainly pricked up! Luisa then upgraded us to a Deluxe Suite with stunning views over Green Park. The suite was huge with two wonderfully opulent rooms and a stunning marble bathroom. An ice bucket of champagne, fresh fruit and flowers had been left for us and there was a lovely touch of a basket of baby products such as wipes, nappies, lotions and shampoo. There were numerous other touches and features that just left us feeling 'wow'. Nothing was too much effort and the staff work tirelessly to make your stay as exceptional as possible. They remember your names despite there being hundreds of guests and make you feel truly special throughout your stay. We had a lovely breakfast the next morning - the buffet area had so many wonderful options and the cooked breakfast made to order was delivered in typically refined style by waiters in tie and tails. Only one word can describe our stay from start to finish... CLASS. Everything about it was just top notch. A big thank you to Luisa in the reservations team for being so lovely.

Although the afternoon tea has a long time tradition in The Ritz, the selection of the food items including the pastries especially the sandwiches lack a bit of creativity in taste and presentation. The service was good, yet we had the impression that there was ""rushing"" in general, in describing the set, the cakes etc. The second service of the tea was mistaken as we received twice the same tea though we have ordered different flavours for each one of us, the Morocco Mint and the Chocolate Flavor.The hotel room is comfortable, quite, nicely designed and very well equipped. The TV Channel selection is very good and entertaining. The only comment would be the lack of a water boiler as this is a regular commodity in many hotels these days.The breakfast was also a good experience, the choice of items and the quality is on a very high scale. Some minor comments are on the toast which was almost burned.

The waiters took us through the menu, the sommelier helped us navigate the bible that is the wine list, and we settled down, champagne glass in hand, to enjoy the ambiance of this most beautiful space.We started with delicious amuse-bouche, that looked like mignardises, but were delicately savoury. Starters included quail with grapes and artichoke royal. We chose loin of lamb with charred leeks and halibut. For pudding, we plumped for a wonderful rhubarb and grenadine confection. the wines were a light Burgundy red(!) with the main course, and a 30-year old Gewurtztraminner with dessert. Coffee was served with flair and efficiency, and the real mignardises were outstandingly good. The one slightly odd note was the small orchestra, who were rather loud for the singer.

The Ritz isn't the cheapest place for lunch that's for sure but what you get is perfect Michelin star food and not a feeling that you've wasted your money. The wine menu is a book and the sky is the limit so can be daunting so take a look on line before going to get an idea - we chose the white Picpoul de Pinet at £45, suggested by my lovely friend in the wine business, and it was amazing even though it was the cheapest  - a mix between Sauvignon and Chardonnay.

HollyFrancis87,46,82,A gorgeous Hotel,[5.0],"Beautiful traditional Hotel right in the heart of Mayfair / knightsbridge.A real buzzing atmosphere welcomes you in the lobby amongst huge floral arrangements. We were welcomed by friendly reception staff who gave us a guided tour and a lovely upgrade (2 levels higher than the room we had paid) as it was my birthday treat. 30th. We had a gorgeous little birthday cake waiting for us in the room too.The Ravilo bar (I think it was called this) had a very cool selection of cocktails. We had two champagne cocktails, ladened with gold (yes, really).The Casino (downstairs - and is a members only club unless you are staying at the hotel) is luxurious and rich.Make sure you take a trip down there even if just for a cocktail - it's open 24 hour and a pretty cool experience. There was no availability or afternoon tea which was disappointing, as a hotel resident perhaps the hotel could ensure a couple of tables be reserved for guests that had not booked this.No tea / coffee making facilities in the room - this was one of my only negatives. I think when you go to the Ritz and pay Ritz prices for everything, and are aware of the standard levels the hotel has to sustain, you do naturally look for perfection.I am a huge coffee lover, and so was disappointed to not be able to have a cup upon waking in the morning.Also only other negative is the breakfast finished quite early and for us, we were on a mini-break (not having to get up for work!!) so we would have liked to have had our breakfast later - we actually missed breakfast, as it didn't suit us to get up and eat before 10am. This is a shame as the breakfast is not cheap!The restaurant is incredible. We had a meal there and were stunned by the artistic and delicious food. It is strictly Tie only for the gents, which we had not realised. luckily the cloakroom had some spare ties at hand, and we were granted entry (lol).The meal for 2 people (three course and a glass of champagne each) came to approx £260. What we learnt at the end was that the restaurant holds a Michelin star, and is on the way to applying for a second! Top quality food and the dining room was lavish. We loved it! So much atmosphere and the service was second to none.Would love to come back !!", January 2018, Travelled as a couple

We had pre drinks in the reception area and then were called into the main restaurant for tea. As you would expect it isn’t cheap for drinks but this is a one time experience and we weren’t watching the pennies. That said watch out for the offer of champagne at the tea table, some of our family assumed they were complimentary....silly really no such thing as a free drink!We also thought that we might be hungry after a few sandwiches but fear not, I promise you will leave feeling rather full after some nice but simple sandwiches.

I never had to fill up my glass at any point and we didn't feel rushed at all. A wedding party were there and a table of 10 in front of us but you had plenty of room around you (unlike the afternoon tea there - a bit less space) our waiter was very proud to work there and you could tell this in his delivery of service.

Location it is perfect and great shopping a short stroll away. After a 25 hour flight we ventured into the Rivoli Bar and had a light meal with cocktails. Great staff and food, very loud so got out of there and went to bed. Breakfast is wonderful i must say but what i did not realise is that there is a serious dress code even for breakfast, to my wifes astonishment she said ""Your kidding"". Nope not at all, yet as we had dressed appropriately there were others in the restaurant that looked as though they had crawled out of a bus. Our second night the room next door had there radio so loud from 6am that i nearly burst a blood vessel yet my wife calmed me down, otherwise it all went well.We are glad that we visited the famed Ritz yet i wouldnt return, not because it was a bad experience; we do enjoy the finer things in life yet in a not so formal manner. (If you are looking for a 5 star experience yet in a not so formal setting then this place is not for you), if you enjoy parading your Chanel etc then it is the place.We chose not to visit the Ritz Casino as i have a problem with gaming establishments so unable to comment on that.", January 2018, Travelled as a couple

Emma A,50,10,Disapointed,[3.0],"I perhaps was expecting too much from the Ritz - when you hear and read up on what it's meant to be and I totally disappointed myself. I booked two rooms for 4 nights and can honestly say I wasn't that impressed with it at all. I booked the rooms a year in advance and confirmed I would be there at the check in time - when we arrived, our rooms were not ready and we were asked if we would like to upgrade at a nominal charge into rooms which were available and we decided not to. They then kindly offered us some upgrades which was lovely - they rooms were King Exec which I can't complain about at all - the rooms needed a little upkeep and my two children fought over the one chocolate that was left on the second night. Turn down service didn't happen every night and we weren't overly impressed with the meal we had at the dinner / dance evening. The decor downstairs was outstanding and the concierge could not be faulted at all - the gentleman even had my husband watch replied for us at a reasonable price. The bathroom appeared to have been used while out for the day which was reported to the front desk. A cup of tea was only available in the restaurant or at a nominal fee for room service. The Christmas Tree and decor was everything I imagined but unfortunately the service wasn't all there from all aspects and one would expect this for the pricing one pays.", December 2017, Travelled with family

The service was the best service I have received in my life. It was a great experience and the atmosphere was wonderful. On the Ritz website they do great gift voucher deals that you get a lot for your money rather than just booking a table. My voucher cost £175 for two people but if you was to just book a table and order straight off the bat I expect it would be double that price so it’s Defo worth a look!!! Overall incredible food in a truly incredible setting., October 2017, Travelled with family

UpJacobsCreek,53,10,Afternoon tea for 70th Birthday ,[5.0],"Wow!!!! I cannot rave about this place enough!  We attended an ‘early’ afternoon tea at 11am, for my mums 70th Birthday.  I arranged beforehand for champagne on arrival and a cake to be brought to the table.  The champagne was offered and as mum is not a fan of champagne a Buck’s Fizz was prepared instead to her request.  The sandwiches and tea came out... which we believed to be it.... but no.... the tea was regularly topped up as were the sandwiches until we confirmed that we had our fill.   We then moved to scones(again we were asked if we wanted more) and then offered a choice of fresh cream cakes from a trolley.   Once we had our fill of these and the petit fours on the table.... the waiters sang happy birthday to my mum and presented her with the cake.  I thought when ordering the cake it would be a small fruit cake for one.... when it arrived I was gobsmacked to see it was a regular size cake (certainly enough to feed 8-10).   It was beautiful.  My mum was overwhelmed and overjoyed by the whole experience.  Mum was in total awe at being in such a grand environment with wonderful service. If anyone has any doubts whether to do this.... I would recommend wholeheartedly.  The atmosphere; the service; the food..... it is all a magical experience which I believe is very good value for money.We shall definitely be returning.... next time for my mother in laws birthday!!!", November 2017, Travelled with family

Great drinks, harried waiters, but to be expected with all the guests milling around!We were notified our table was ready and were seated.  Obviously they added more tables to accommodate the crowds, so we were very near others!  The decor for Christmas was beautiful, making the whole tea extra special!We were immediately offered champagne, and a tea tray was brought out with five different sandwiches offfered; everything from mustard and cheese on tomato bread, to egg salad and cucumber sandwiches!  The upper tier held the desserts, which we both generally leave behind.The waiter took our order for Earl GrY tea, giving each of us our own silver pot of tea, everything was preset on the table to help expedite the entire menu.  They give you time to enjoy the tea but also have the next set of guests arriving, so the table must move on!The tier holding the scones held the jams and clotted cream, but as at Harrods, the scones are brought out fresh and hot. Two scones per person, two with raisins, two plain.  Again, these are chewy and rather tough, but the clotted cream and jam help!During the tea, Santa appeared with gifts for children under 15!

Mikhail Borovikov,155,27,The legendary hotel worth staying at. At least once,[4.0],"The Ritz is not the best hotel in London, but is definitely the most famous. Many people say that it is too old-fashioned, it lacks proper gym and the swimming pool, its bar is rather mediocre... yes, it is true. But I really love these small outdated features like leaving the key (real key, not the card) from the room at the reception, afternoon tea (50 pounds per person) at the Palm court and carpeted stairways. The Ritz location is also great: minutes away from the Buckingham Palace, main shopping streets and Westminster abbey.  Green park tube station is just around the corner. The rooms themselves are actually very up-to-date and comfortable: they are spacious with large bed, flat TV and adorable marble bathroom. Bottom line: of you prefer modern stylish hotels and don’t like old-fart carpet-n-gold design, the Ritz is not for you.

Halibut looked like it had just come from Sainsbury's except that it didn't taste as good and it was smothered with sea food which was not indicated on the menu. 5 people could not eat it for religious / allergy reasons and it took this joke of a restaurant 30 mins to bring alternatives which was a sort of bread pudding concoction served without any sweetener. There was a dessert. There were no apologies. I went home angry and hungry. I was totally put off the Ritz.

We were grateful that the staff welcomed us and our startling amount of luggage at such a late hour. However, the woman who led us to our rooms looked us up and down and then pointedly told us not to worry, that the dining room in which breakfast was served did not have a dress code. I let this pass without comment. Despite our obvious exhaustion, this same person lingered in our suite long after familiarizing us with the its particulars; we were relieved when she was left and we could finally collapse into our pyjamas. Our suite was enormous -- with two full baths. The bed was a bit soft, but we slept well. The valet service  pressed two suits and a dress to perfection, allowing us to segue to the next evening's plans without stress. Communication among the staff did seem spotty -- we had staff enter our room on more than one occasion without knocking, well before check-out, despite the DND on the door; room service was off on more than one item of our order, which made us a bit late for our morning appointment. The valet service and the bell desk were top-notch, however. Our last point of contact was with the front desk, at checkout.

NtM70,252,71,"Amazing building, fantastic cocktails, food ok",[4.0],"We treated ourselves to cocktails, champagne & a three course meal at the amazing Ritz. This iconic place does not disappoint - the inside of the building is beautifully frozen in elegant time. It really is fabulous and full of charm. The lounge pianist was wonderful. In the bar we had the Ruby cocktail (we actually had two each as they were so nice) which was wonderful. The staff in the bar were bubbly and friendly. Upon moving to the restaurant, we were unceremoniously 'told' by a member of staff stood opposite the pianist to 'put your bag in the cloakroom' (we were far from laden with lots of bags and would have appreciated a gentler approach).   The restaurant has the most beautiful ceiling which tempts you to look upward rather than around.  Service was 'friendly' but a little false due to the attempts by staff to speak 'well' rather than naturally, we found this rather amusing.    As one would expect, the wine & champagne choice was vast. Our starters - mackerel with radish slices was light and delicious.  Main courses were curious as one of us had fish and the other blackened chicken - the fish had a chicken crumb on it which was odd, both were served with similar accompaniments (the only differences being one had artichokes which were fabulous, the other with celeriac) and both were served with the equivalent of a chicken gravy?!Desert - the most fabulous raspberry soufflé. We loved the entire experience, felt service could move with the times a little without losing any of the charm this place exudes.", November 2017, Travelled with friends

Diana C,53,39,Do it at least once,[5.0],"The Ritz is as imagined. Glorious in its old world luxury and stately grandeur with a slight theatricality that added to our pleasure. It has been on our bucket list for years. The decor, reflecting the old traditions of elegant accommodation is warm and inviting and very much of a period. Do not expect Modern. Foyers, lounge, dining rooms and bar are all extremely comfortable and gracious. Cocktails superb. Waiters, in tie and tails for breakfast, were a hoot. High Tea in the afternoon, a must do, and dinner in the exquisite ball room was divine. Spread these epicurean delights over a few days of course. Service in all areas is impeccable. Ask for Maria in reception (from NY) and she will perform actual miracles for you. The staff is polite, relaxed and very approachable with a, very occasional, hint of condescension just to keep one amused. (If you are not a guest or very smartly dressed, you are kindly and graciously 'invited' to leave)The bedroom, however, was a little disappointing.Generally, I rather enjoy the atmosphere of Shabby Gentility so admired by the British, however, torn Passementeries (decorative trim) on the curtains, cheaply painted white and gold trim Louis furniture, an empty flower vase with smelly water and a toilet cistern that interrupted the flow of the shower were not so impressive at these prices.The halls are automatically and regularly sprayed with a deeply offensive and cloying aroma. Reminiscent of a public toilet. It's always a mad dash to the lift so one doesn't have to take in an unnecessary breath.The option of opening our bedroom window for fresh air of a night was greatly appreciated. The Ritz is definitely 5star and definitely worth a visit, at least once. I will remember it with joy and affection and anticipation !", November 2017, Travelled as a couple
Andrew B,24,14,Simply the best!!,[5.0],"My wife and I had been planning our visit to the Ritz for over a year, as the final leg of a 6 week trip to Europe. We had stayed at the Ritz on our wedding night, 34 years ago. We had called in 2 years ago just for a nostalgic sticky beak when passing. At that time we were greeted in the lobby by Mr Wlodek Ostojski. He couldn’t have been more welcoming and he walked us round the restaurant and function areas and then back to the Palm Court. There he insisted we sit down and have a glass of champagne and he introduced us to Mr Ian Gomes, the resident pianist. Ian regaled us with stories and played us a Sinatra medley while we sipped the champagne.We resolved at that point that we must come back and stay.So last year, when we were planning this trip we corresponded with Maria Sanz, who was extremely helpful in booking our recent 5 night stay.The stay also included a one night stay for my Mum, brother and sister in law for an early celebration of Mum’s 90th, which is in December.On our arrival we were given a warm and friendly welcome by the team at check in. The lovely Louisa from Lisbon took us to our room.The rooms are fantastic with such elegance and quality. The bed was so comfortable and my wife chose from the pillow menu.Breakfast in the Ritz restaurant was very stylish with plenty of choice.When the rest of the family checked in we had dinner at the Ritz Restaurant on the Sunday night and a fabulous high tea in the Palm Court on Monday. Both sensational experiences.We introduced Mum to Ian Gomes and they sang duets of very old songs. Ian gave Mum some CDs of him playing which was very kind.We got to know Michael, one of the doormen, partly due to my morning runs around Hyde/Green parks. Apart from the clear character fault of being a Spurs fan, Michael was a great guy and always welcomed us with a joke.We were delighted to catch up with Mr Ostojski and he was kind enough to send us a bottle of champagne which we all enjoyed with afternoon tea. Another lovely, kind thought.Sandra the chamber maid was a very nice person and we enjoyed seeing her in the evenings.The Ritz is unique because it combines excellence in the property with superb service. It is not stuffy or pompous but stylish, understated and friendly. We found all of the staff to be outstanding and it is obvious that the culture is such that many have worked there for many years. Culture in any organisation is only created over the long term.The Ritz has its own personality which is a combination of its unique location, the beauty of the property, but most of all its fabulous staff.We will be back!!Many thanks to all at the Ritz.", October 2017, Travelled with family

A range of four pastries all very nice. The Ritz royal tea was the best I have ever tasted. Our engraved cake was wonderful and came with candles, was boxed up to take home, and was extremely delicious. We were sat at the table next to each other which was nice as opposed to opposite. Staff were very smart and attentive.Minus points - there are too many tables for me. It was too packed and noisy and we had trouble hearing the waiters at times. Also, with a huge 5 sittings a day there was a definite rush after 80-90 minutes or so to clear the tables, hand out the bills (interesting) and prepare for the next round, I know you cant sit there indefinitely and they have a job to do, but I wasn't as relaxed as at The Savoy.

On arrival in the restaurant we were shown to a lovely table at the left edge of the restaurant as you walk in. The menu was extensive too. The food and service excellent but have to say let the side down when after my husband ordering three different bottles of expensive wine they had none of them to the embarrassment of the head sommelier. Eventually the nice chap went to the cellar to see what he could do and came back and redeemed himself shall I say but should never happen in a five star hotel and have stayed at the Dorchester and Claridges and never have been in this situation so slightly embarrassing for a while.By the time we finished our meal the entertainment had started some time ago but enjoyed the last 10-15 minutea of it. I have to say I think it's wrong when staying as a guest at the hotel and paying £550 a night that you have to pay at least £70 on top for entertainment that we hardly saw due to the wine waiter trying to get us a wine which had sold out. The next morning we ate breakfast at the wolseley across the road and have to say what an excellent breakfast it was and delivered fast and tasty. All in all a very pleasant stay but could of been better for the money we paid for one night as it was a special night, August 2017, Travelled as a couple

The concierges are the soul of The Ritz, Michael, Sachi, Andy, Paul, Mark... all of them, they make the most of your stay. Reception desk also very efficient and welcoming. There is still room for improvement as we saw some flaws in service this time, breakfast at the beautiful main restaurant has always been perfect but now every order takes its time,  the waiters seem to be less than usual and although they are very nice it seems as they are less than usual, also we suspect there are  less people backstage, orders can take 25 minutes to arrive...a little too much.. .grapefruit juice ""was not available this morning"" for a couple of days although we could always see grapefruit (the fruits) on the buffet table.  I love the perfect suites and decoration but I still hope to see a nespresso coffee machine and tea facilities in the room next time. This is a must have.

Truly a 5 star venue with staff that realise this and uphold the standard. Beautiful dining room with well dressed staff who were all highly attentive and thoroughly professional. The food was exquisite. We both had monkfish starters....amazing. The Mrs then had the tortellini and I had the Jacobs ladder ( think slow cooked pork belly ). Can't fault any of it. Service is also a little theatrical,  adding to the experience.  The set lunch menu is, admittedly,  quite limited with 3 starters 3 mains and 2 desserts plus cheese. However there is something for pretty much everyone at a good value price. There are also delicious little treats at the start and end of the meal. Wine is expensive but always is in these places. This was a fabulous day out with excellent food. Highly recommended as a treat or a gift for someone into their food. We will be back.", October 2017, Travelled as a couple

Thus, I had made up my mind to go for this finest tradition of the British. However, as I was not sure of my schedule or other activities, I did not make any reservation. This mistake is not to be repeated by anyone of you, as this Afternoon Tea is very popular, even though there are five seatings daily, and thus often filled up fast. As I was alone, I managed to get the help from the concierge to eventually get one table for myself due to a last minute cancellation.I love the opulence of the whole setting at the Palm Court, where we were served the Afternoon Tea. There are hanging chandeliers with large mirrors by the side, and it was so elegant. There is a pianist who will play music while we indulge in the whole dining experience.There are six varieties of freshly prepared sandwiches, freshly baked scones, and pastries of various small cakes. Every mouthful of the food is so delightful, and do not forget about the Cornish clotted cream and strawberry preserve.Good to note that the Ritz London is the only hotel in the UK with a certified Tea Sommelier, who actually travels around the world to the various tea plantations to source for their wonderful tea selections. I chose to have the exclusive Ritz Royal Tea Blend, which is a mix of Kenyan, Assam and Ceylon Orange Tea. I love it!

Beautiful canapés and petits fours are also included. There is also an extensive a la carte menu. We chose a bottle of champagne to accompany the meal.

We visited the Ritz Club which was great fun and not to be missed, had drinks at the Ravioli bar, room-service and excellent dinner at the restaurant (the vegan-menu was the best I have had so far). Two observetaions for management consideration: 1. The use of smart-phones is something to be tolorated in this day and age and as for the use of them I am no exception. However, during our dinner at the beautiful restaurant a group on a near-by table was on the verge of vulgar. The whole experience was reccorded on iphones by every guest at that table, which could be annoying but adding flash to the deed made it almost unbearable  for those of us sitting in the line of the light. This almost made me give the hotel 4 stars in stead of 5, but since this probably was beyond anything the great staff that night had experienced and were not prepaired for, I stick with the 5.The hotel has a dress-code and it would not be out of order to advise guests gently on this. 2. We missed not having coffee making facilities in the room, but I do guess the hotel has giving this a thought, however, I just wanted to mention this.

My only negative is not everyone has exactly the same choice of sweet things, so certain items need to be shared. Easily said.Don't let sway you.", September 2017, Travelled as a couple
Sarah P,36,16,Such a lovely hotel.,[5.0],"We have stayed at several 5-star hotels in London, but this was our first time at the Ritz.We truly enjoyed it.  The locale was brilliant - right in the middle of everything, but without it being too noisy in your room.IMO, the Ritz can sound fuddy-duddy - like maybe it was cool in the 80's - but I was pleasantly surprised at the top-notch service, modern amenities and beautiful room.The room.  One has to remember they're in London, and the more over-the-top, ornate decor a hotel can offer, the more 'authentic' a British experience one is getting.The Ritz room was BLINDING in it's ornate-ness.  Florals everywhere, crown molding and trim on every inch of wall space, marble in the entire bathroom, and chrome fixtures.  I wasn't sure at first how to feel about it, but it really grew on me.  Makes you feel a bit like you're living at the palace.Room service did not disappoint.  They offer the usual posh breakfasts, like a japanese version, and mimosas with their own champagne.  I liked that.(except no baked beans - bummer!)The lobby and dining areas were gorgeous.  You knew you were staying in a 5-star hotel.We didn't partake in the tea service or dine at the Ritz - the bellhop razed us a bit jokingly that we were going to the 'competition', when we left for tea at the Dorchester.  But I wish we would have tried tea at the Ritz...  it looked lovely, and maybe a bit 'hipper' than the usual Dorchester tea scene.We both really enjoyed this hotel, and will likely be returning.", July 2017, Travelled as a couple

I was impressed that with so many guests that after speaking with someone in the hotel once the next time I saw him/her I would be greeted by name. The room decor is not my style - it is what I would describe as old world grand hotel but it works in this property. The location of the hotel is great and convenient for both leisure and business travellers. As a gym enthusiast, I was disappointed by the gym.

We had afternoon tea and dined in the restaurant on Ritz party night, reviews for these will be posted separately. The service was as to be expected for the price you pay in a hotel with the reputation of the Ritz.

Being the Ritz you are paying top dollar (or pound) but the service, food and ambience is fabulous and well worth the money for a special treat. We had four course with a glass of champagne and a bottle of wine. Whilst we didn't like the second course which was a cheese type course everything else was presented beautifully and tasted lovely. We couldn't manage the petit fours so they gave us a box to take them home with and they also gave me a surprise birthday cake which I also took away in a box.A singer entwined us and then two dancers performed old style dances.What a lovely evening. It was also interesting to see the other people out celebrating as well as those people who treat this as a daily way of life.If you can afford it, well worth the visit. They do a more reasonable lunch and an afternoon tea with pianist. Definitely one for the bucket list.", August 2017, Travelled with friends

Persika,48,58,Historic but requires refurbishment,[4.0],"1.  I see many raving reviews of the restaurant service.  We did not eat here, but the tea service seemed majestic and elegant.  This will only be a review of the rooms and over night stay.2.  The staff are curteous and very helpful.3.  I understand that the hotel is a historic venue, but it is in need of serious refurbishement.  The walls are covered with multiple layers of paint over the years and one can see the chipped under layers or at times corners.  The rooms overall are sumptous in design but when looking at details, the furniture, the walls and the flooring all have serious signs of time.  Similar hotels have managed to mainain the historic elements while refurbishing their rooms. We enjoyed the morning wake up call and in room coffee which was very pleasant.Overall, I think this is probably a better hotel to enjoy for a meal and a visit to the ground floor restaurants rather than a stay, especially when considering the price for a family suite.", August 2017, Travelled with family

We all loved the whole experience and I am already thinking of booking again to celebrate another occasion. The staff were extremely accommodating and made the boys feel very welcomed and relaxed. Both my husband and I had a glass of champagne to start and the boys were served fresh orange juice in a champagne glass. The sandwiches, warm scones and handmade individual cakes were delicious and as soon as they started to go down, they were replenished. The large choice of teas was lovely and just when we thought that we could not eat another thing, the cake trolley came round. We also ordered a mini birthday cake to mark the occasion which came out with the pianist playing 'happy birthday'.

Craig821,12,3,Classic British style and hospitality,[5.0],"This was our first time at the property and we loved the Ritz London.  Our reception at the front desk was warm and very informative.  The gentleman checking us in, also walked with us to the room and continued to let us know about the history of the hotel and all related amenities.  Our room was beautiful and functional.  My wife and I were traveling alone and it was a perfect romantic getaway.  In my opinion this property is not conducive to bringing children as there is an air of formality which we loved.Breakfast is phenomenal with many cold and hot options.  We also loved cocktails in the Rivoli Bar and dinner downstairs in the Ritz Club.  The only advice I would give is Tea at the Ritz and dinner in the dining room require jacket and tie.  While I didn't have a tie with me, they offered one but I declined.  For our next trip, my wife and I make sure we have appropriate evening dress so we can enjoy dinner in the main room.  If that had been clear we would have eaten more dinners in.Location is perfect and easy to hit many key sites.

I was expecting something a bit too classic and crowded with Japanese tourists.

Great service, great location and very well look after facilities (not faded at all).I will get back whenever I am in London with any of my kids as we really enjoy a great weekend together (partly thanks to the concierge who coordinated all of the activities for us).

When arrived, the staff are all very polite and helpful, offering to take photos, help nan up the stairs and point us in the direction where to go. I was expecting the staff to be a bit up themselves if I'm honest - but I was wrong! They were all very friendly, helpful and social. Although they were well spoken, they even made the occasional joke!The decoration inside the hotel is obviously amazing. Really astounding and beautiful. The staff are all dressed smart also. Don't forget that you have to dress smart to be let in! I was carrying my jacket/blazer and the staff politely told me I have to put it on when I was in the afternoon-tea area. We were early, so we asked if we could have a drink first and they immediately took us to a suitable table in the bar-area. Even though it looked really busy, they still waited on us very promptly. There was such a huge menu of drinks available, plus more if there was anything you fancied that wasn't on the menu! They were fast bringing over the drinks. As a group, we had such fun and couldn't stop laughing - we were worried the staff would tell us to be quiet, as everyone else in the restaurant/bar-area appeared very quiet! But they didn't, they let us have a good time as we were. Obviously the prices were a wee bit high, but you will expect that with a place like this. I think the cheapest bottle of white wine was £60. The afternoon tea. The cakes, sandwiches, scones, tea - so much to choose from and it was all really fresh and delicious! So many different flavours/variations of each! For our nan's birthday, they prepared a cake and wrote her name on it in icing. As we were so full, they packed it into a 'Ritz'-box and let us take it away with us when we left.

I have stayed at the best properties around the world and this ranks as one of the best.  Great location.  Amazing rooms.  Outstanding service from every single employee at the hotel.  Any room is great but for a real treat book a deluxe suite-- you will feel like you are staying in a room at Versailles.  The specialty suites are even better if you can afford them.  The restaurant is Michelin starred and high tea is a must(champagne included).  Any request or whim is pleasantly granted as if you have your own genie at hand.  The rooms have cell phone which you can take with you outside of the hotel.  They guide you around London and find shops and restaurants for you and direct you to their location.  With a touch of a button you are connected to the hotel if you need more assistance.  For the best suites you are picked up at the airport in the hotel's Rolls Royce.  While the rooms are not cheap, this hotel is more affordably priced than the other 5 star properties in London.  On Green Park, next to Buckingham Palace, near Hyde Park, in Mayfair, and 3 blocks from Bond Street, you couldn't ask for a better location.  I recommend this hotel without reservation.

Charlie E,12,4,You're paying a lot for the name ,[3.0],"My wife and I have just had a two night stay at the Ritz London for a birthday weekend away.The good things, very friendly staff upon arrival, especially the door men, porters and reception staff who are fantastic and very friendly. Great breakfast, in beautiful surroundings. The drawbacks, rooms are elegant and traditional but very dated. We had a deluxe suite and the carpet and decor could have done with a once over. One major surprise is that there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. We asked twice for a kettle and some cups so my wife could make a hot water but they never came. I'm guessing this is so you have to pay the £13 for a cup of tea on room service. We had an afternoon tea that had been booked since March. Upon arrival they didn't have our booking even though I had the email trail to show. Luckily there was no  issue and we went straight in. If there had of been it would have destroyed the weekend as it was the main reason for the visit and my wife's birthday present. Tea and cakes were nice though.Last little grumble is the hotel could be considered a little pretentious in places. Especially when you walk in to the foyer wearing your trainers and slogs after a day of walking miles around London and you're asked if you can be helped that can only be taken as the staff don't think you are staying there. All in all, worth a night to tick it off the list, but stayed in far nicer hotels in London for the same or not much more money.", August 2017, Travelled as a couple

The bed was beautifully decorated with a set of rose petals arranged in a heart shape; very thoughtful and much appreciated.The room was lovely, comfortable bed and good pillows, large bathrooms and all the fixtures and fittings. In a slightly rogue move I ordered the classic burger and chips at about 1am but damn it was good. Chips were definitely triple cooked.We awoke and went down for breakfast and this is where I believe The Ritz experience exceeds many of the other hotels I have stayed in.

Next course was scones and clotted cream, again a separate plate gluten free. Then came the pastries, decadent and delicious. Finally the cake trolley, pear tart or fruit cake. Here again a gluten free slice of cake was served to my niece. The dress code is smart, so dress up coz you will feel special.

I can see why it is one of the best hotels in the world, given the unbelievable kindness and brilliant service we have received on our second stay with a third following shortly.  The breakfast room, which doubles as a very elegant dining room during the day, is magnificent.  A cold continental breakfast is provided buffet style, with hot food individually ordered from one of the waiters in dinner suits.  Tea comes in sterling silver pots, with a pot of boiling water....only the English understand the true protocol of tea drinking!  The tradition of high tea at the Ritz is still an English right of passage with a long waiting list to obtain a reservation.  The location adjacent to Green Park and the tube on Piccadilly is very convenient to everything, and within walking distance to Harrods. Mayfair, Buckingham Palace and St James Park, Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey and most sites of interest.

danvega,53,67,The glitz in the ritz,[5.0],"If you plan to visit this establishment i suggest not to read any reviews. I know i didnt.The only thing you need to read before arriving is the history of this great landmark.Now should you be more stubborn and insist, i put together some impressions we have been left with:It is a fairytale experience from the arrival to the end of your stay and the porters are the magic doorkeepers - the first and the last you will see on your trip.The front desk, the concierge with their uniformes and their unwavering politeness, awareness and availability, everyone and everything looks like they have been stuck in a time when the empires literally still ruled the world.Upon checking-in you will most likely encounter the usuals, the people that frequent this hotel and some that can even call it home, people whose lives differ from ours in such a way that they are blissfully unaware of reviews, they would just show up and have a great time.For a review in its classical sense will undeniably tarnish and reduce this magic place down to every other hotel that a commoner has access to.And now i would like to bring into consideration the value for money aspect which will be a deal-maker or breaker for aspiring guests and tripadvisor readers: in my opinion, rubbing shoulders with the world elite and living like royals or hollywood stars from a bygone era should not be accesible to many. This hotel somehow breaks with tradition and even has special offers, perhaps a product of mainstreaming and ultimately a business decision, but dont get fooled - while you and I may join the ranks of the super rich for one moment in time, never forget that some people have lived decades in this hotel taking up whole floors together with their entourage and the level of luxury and attention to detail they requested and received is unimaginable.For the tech-savvy and the fact-finding group i will not dwell much on the tiredness of some old furniture or the cracked bathroom tiles or even the flaky paint on the closet doors, the noisy electric shutters and the difficult to operate windows, but i will highlight the amazing water pressure from the shower or the sink faucet (something you would not expect from a +100yrs old building) or the very efficient and decently quiet air conditioning system, even the fantastic bronze antique electrical/lighting appliances, or the combination of old-fashioned and modern doorkey entry system.What i could not get over easily are some things that chipped this perfect fairytale image:The less than flattering cheap plastic toilet seat cover which had absolutely no place in a hotel like this.The tired springy bed mattress which seemed past its best before date.And the unfortunate view from the back of the hotel over other nearby buildings and the continous rumble from the airconditioning units down below, very obvious when you opened the windows.Anywhere you go there is a photo shooting opportunity, hardly resisted even by the locals. The decorations are amazing and the overall feeling is of being hosted in a museum rather than a hotel.The breakfast is offered in the main restaurant and this is one of those moments you will most likely enjoy. The high ceiling and massive bronze decorations together with the heavily mirrored and painted walls elevate this mere breakfast to an oppulent occasion of delight and culinary bliss. The options are not as varied as one might expect, but their quality and the a la carte menu plus the staffs exemplary level of service will leave no indulgence to be desired.Anything goes in this hotel, you just have to ask for it and they will take care of it - from a reservation to a restaurant in the city that you can not make on your own for the next fortnight, to a spontaneous taste for out of season pomegranate after breakfast, it will happen.Also in this setting, dinner is served. Like the afternoon tea sessions (all 5 of them with the earliest starting at 1130 due to demand) served in the fabulous Palm Court, access here is possible only with reservation well in advance (except for hotel guests) and of course the customary dress code of evening wear for ladies and jacket and tie for gents. Top hats for elderly men are common also. The Rivoli Bar is a bit tight for space and usually full and its designed in such a way to reproduce the interiors of the famous Orient Express. Here you can walk straight in with casual dress code.Having lived in London for some years and being familiar with the Piccadilly area, and walking or driving by this masterpiece establishment frequently on my ways, i would always fantasize about what would it be like to be a guest.But never had i imagined that once we became guests of The Ritz, coming back to the hotel every day we felt like coming home.And for this feeling alone i would recommend this luxury hotel even for a weekend.We will return here and we were advised to check out the even more impressive Paris Ritz too, they say.", June 2017, Travelled as a couple

Rachael C,13,15,Second Honeymoon ,[5.0],"There are hotels and then there is The Ritz. We chose to stay on a 'Simply Sunday' package which included a Superior Queen Room, a bottle of their signature champagne in the room on arrival, a three course dinner in the Michelin starred restaurant and breakfast the following morning. We were greeted by the lovely doorman who took care of our luggage and then attended to swiftly, politely and amicably  by reception. Oscar showed us to our room and gave us a small tour and brief history of the hotel before we we welcomed by flowers, champagne and chocolates. What a credit to The Ritz this young man is. Our room was stunning. From the monogrammed bedding to the heavyweight  curtains - everything was of superlative quality. We used the pressing service for my evening dress and my husband's dress shirt. It was lovely to be treated like treasured guests and given such efficient service. We dressed for Dinner and were in awe of how beautiful the hotel looked upon descending the stairs. Nothing prepared us for how magnificent the lobby looked and smelled due to the flower arrangements. The pianist, who has been in residence for many years and even has a cocktail named after him, was a delight to hear. The food was superlative. Without exception the best we have ever tasted. The waiter, David, was incredibly knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The only downside was the loud, obnoxious and rude American woman and her daughter seated on the table next to us. The daughter sat on her phone all evening singing along to YouTube and the Mother, despite being late for dinner, asked for the team to hurry and even enquired as to whether she could have the food to ""take out""! Go to McDonald's dear, this is the Ritz! Money can buy you opportunity but it certainly cannot buy class or appreciation of the finest things in life. This wasn't the hotel's fault, they dealt with the vulgarity with polite firmness. I only mention it to state that if ever I were to take for granted how wonderful this experience is and how lucky I am to have eaten and resided there, I would need shooting. The Rivoli Bar is a stunning bar that we used for a post-dinner cocktail. The waiter was very quirky and had immense knowledge to pass on regarding Charlie Chaplin's long association with The Ritz. Upon return to our room, we found that the maid had performed the turn down duty but had left the most beautiful display of fresh rose petals on our bed and set the TV to be playing Debussy. This was so unexpected and shows how wonderful the team at The Ritz are. We slept wonderfully on the extremely comfortable bed, in the expensive high thread counted sheets and again, had superlative food at breakfast. We cannot wait to return. We are in love with The Ritz. Thank you so much for making our anniversary so very special.", July 2017, Travelled as a couple

I appreciate this is a tourist area but the way the doorman acted was inexcusable and a complete embarrassment to the establishment.

You get the sort of service you expect from a hotel of this calibre and would recommend to anyone its worth spending at least 1 night there.I have stayed in a lot of the top hotels in London such as the Shard and 4 Seasons, however the Ritz tops them in a lot of ways. If you're looking for a weekend of feeling like royalty in a glitzy luxury hotel, you cant go far wrong at all!

The location is right on Green Park and is pretty central with a Tube Station right next to the hotel. There are a lot of choices for  high end shopping right at your doorstep. In addition, there are some discount shops for snacks and the like across the street which always come in handy when traveling with a family.  My daughter had a cold and the woman that checked us in was very concerned and brought her some tea. The public areas in the hotel are world class and the rooms are over the top. I would say the bathrooms could use some updates as well as some new mattresses. If you are all about ""Puttin on the Ritz"" and want the experience-- go for it.

Harry,10,14,Lovely but slow,[5.0],"We visited the hotel for dinner after the Chelsea Flower Show. Of course the Ritz is world famous and deserves its reputation as a world class hotel; the interiors are magnificent, staff well trained and food delicious. The only element of our evening which let the place down was the Rivoli Bar. Whilst it is extremely beautiful - one has the feeling of sitting inside a Tiffany's jewel box - and the cocktails are the best I've ever tasted, the staff perhaps take themselves a little seriously. It took a long time to be severed by the haughty bar manager and after-dinner cocktails, taken in a separate lounge outside the dining room, took thirty minutes to arrive. This wasn't much of a problem - such is the relaxing power of jazz music, but half an hour does seem rather too long to wait (particularly given the small size of the bar.) However staff were extremely apologetic and seemed to mind much more than we did. The rest of the evening was faultless: perfect dining and service which seems more akin to a well choreographed dance than mere table-waiting. I can't wait to return.", June 2017, Travelled with friends
Yvonne B,138,40,Overnight Stay and Live at the Ritz,[5.0],"My husband and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  It was arranged and paid for by our children who wanted to treat us to something special.   The hotel is absolutely beautiful.  Having visited Buckingham Palace I prefer The Ritz!  We were treated like VIP’s on arrival and check in was seamless.  We were shown around the hotel by a delightful lady before she took us up to our room.  The room was fabulous and I loved the bathroom!  The toiletries were gorgeous!  We enjoyed a drink in the Rivoli Bar before dinner having booked a table when we checked in.  The bar is visually stunning with a lively, relaxed atmosphere.  We had booked a table in the restaurant for 7.30 pm to enjoy ‘Live at the Ritz.’  The restaurant is beyond words - absolutely exquisite.  The waiters were wonderful – friendly, professional, knowledgeable, enthusiastic – I could go on.  I loved the synchronised ‘lid lifting’ especially when serving a large group.  It somehow made the meal feel even more special.  The food was amazing.  We chose the four course menu where you had a choice of courses and served together with appetizers, a choice of breads and petit fours made for a very substantial meal.  The live music and dancers were excellent and we enjoyed a dance ourselves – along with lots of other guests.  We ended our meal with the most delicious coffee where we had several cups each.  In all we were in the restaurant for over four hours and had one of the best evenings of our lives.  We were made to feel welcome by the staff and enjoyed friendly conversation with other guests which, to be honest, we were not expecting to do.  We left the restaurant about 11.45 pm and what a treat to wander through the hotel back to our room at that time of night – not many people about and we could look at the hotel and enjoy its beauty to ourselves.  I truly did not want to leave and to be honest felt a bit tearful – which for me is a sign I have had the best time.  We are already planning a return visit.", June 2017, Travelled as a couple

It was a place she had always wanted to stay and we weren't disappointed. Walking through the foyer you can really feel the history and opulence of the hotel. The check in staff were friendly and attentive and had to let us into the room as there was a small issue with the key. The lady who helped us took time to show us where everything was and left us to settle in. The room looked very palatial with its chandelier and gold bedspread. Bed was super comfortable and we both had a great nights sleep. The room was however a little shabby in places with door handles missing, scuffed skirting boards and old drips around the mirror.

Air con seemed to have a hard time keeping up with the beginning of summer, and the room temperature never cooled down to the wished for temperature.Breakfast was nice but not really worth the price. Good coffee and nice looking coffee pots, unfortunately they did not keep the coffee warm for long, and one morning we had to wait 30 minutes for a refill! Staff overall very nice and helpful just as you would expect in any hotel, roomservice excellent. Had quite high expectations to the Ritz, and was not disappointed, but on the other hand did not really get the ""wauw-feeling"". For the price paid one might expect just a little more.

Our 7th floor room was fabulous and had an outstanding view of the well known landmarks. Breakfast is served in the Ritz Restaurant and it definitely has to be the most beautiful dining room in the world. We had the Champagne Afternoon Tea on the day of our Anniversary & the sandwiches, scones and pastries are exquisite. We also send a big thank you to the Housekeeping Team who took the time to dress our bed & room with a large number of rose petals which was a very nice touch. We ate & drank on numerous occasions in The Rivoli Bar where there is an excellent variety of food and drink on the menu. On each visit we were welcomed and looked after extremely well and huge thanks to Andre and his Team for that. There is a dress code to adhere to, for Gentleman a jacket and tie must be worn for Afternoon Tea and for lunch and dinner in the Ritz Restaurant and Terrace. Smart casual attire is suitable in all other areas and there are some items of clothing that are not permitted so check on the website for these.

This service is £60 for 24 hours, I thought this was quite reasonable after doing research of other car parks in the area.Check in was smooth, staff very friendly and welcoming, we arrived early so left our luggage at the hotel and went shopping. Piccadilly is around a 10 minute walk. You can find a large range of cafes and restaurants in the area of the hotel.When we arrived back to the hotel we were shown to our room. Our room was very impressive with a large bedroom and fireplace and a lovely view of green park, we had a dressing room and a bathroom with bath and a separate shower.

MelSchmid,21,6,Beautiful rooms,[4.0],"Pros:This Hotel is simply gorgeous and is so greatly known for a good reason. The service was great with very polite and mood lifting staff. The rooms were very spacious, which is uncommon for such old hotel especially in Europe. Its location is very convenient and the view is not too bad. The food in their restaurant is also delicious. Cons:Before I meantion these cons, I would like to say that these critiques are very picky and did not make our stay at The Ritz unpleasent. -The tea roomIt was always fully booked even for hotel guests. Everything exceeds expectation except the fact that even as a hotel guest who booked one suite and on normal room you can't get a table in their famous tea room/ tea garden. You have to book it at least a week in advance (at least that was the case during the 4 days we were there). As we didn't know about that when we booked the hotel through american express, we didn't get a table at any time during our stay in the hotel. As such a high class hotel, I would have expected from them to keep a few tables for hotel guests but nothing could be done.However they did serve us scones and tea at the bar and therefore I must say they do try their best to keep the guests happy. -The drive inThere is not much space in front of the hotel for cars to stop which can lead to some traffic. Can create a hectic mood. -Dress code?A very strict dress code for their restaurant. Too some this might not be an issue and I understand that I is somewhat part of the cultural experience of the traditional British etiquette. My fiance who didn't bring a suit with him to London, had to rent the whole set (blazer, pants and tie) and the cloak room. This was rather and amusing experience; might however end up frustrating to some.", March 2017, Travelled with family
IanLynnO,52,12,Cocktails and Sweet Dreams.....,[5.0],"We stayed at this magnificent piece of English heritage for One night in Early May.It truly is everything you would expect from such a high spec hotel. Beautiful architecture and gorgeus furnishings as soon as you walk through the door. The only glitch we had was on check in where we were told the room was not ready, 45 minutes later we were guided to our room (616) with a glass of Complimentary Champagne for our inconvenience. The room was simply stunning, loads of space, a huge bed with the best pillows ever. Full sky Tv, a docking station and a mobile for you to use at your leisure in or out of the hotel. The Bathroom has heated flooring and a powerful shower. We never used the bath, but loved the bathrobes and slippers.  After a night at The Royal Albert Hall we returned for drinks in The Ritz Club which you are allowed to use if you are a guest. Entry is through a 'secret door' that leads down a beautiful staircase to the bar and Casino. Like something out of a James Bond movie, amazing, and a must visit if you can, but i'd stay clear of the Gaming tables unless you are very lucky or very wealthy.  On returning to our room the maids had been and replenished the bathroom and turned down the bed covers for us, another nice little touch. BEST NIGHTS SLEEP EVER. We never had a chance to sample breakfast as we had booked afternoon tea at 11.30am   Afternoon Tea is a truly memorable experience that has been repeatedly and highly reviewed on here for good reason so I won't repeat all the kind words, although the Harpist playing while having Tea and Scones is Magical.   Cocktails in the afternoon from The Beautiful  Rivoli Bar was Splendid, plenty of choice and you can watch them being made, a special mention to Andreas who was very charming and informative on how the cocktails and engraved Ice cubes are made.

First time went with the girls and second time with the hubby.  We knew there was a dress code but hadn't checked the details on our booking which states that gents should all have tie and jacket.  We arrived and the staff let us know that a jacket and tie was required and we were able to borrow this from the cloakroom.  Great that they haven't let standards slip.  Another customer rushed in late and had jeans on, no tie, took his jacket off and rolled his sleeves up!! They soon asked him politely to change his clothes.  He came back with trousers, tie and jacket!!  Good for the Ritz lets keep it special for everyone :)", May 2017, Travelled as a couple

Lynda P,34,13,The experience of a lifetime.,[5.0],"I booked this stay as a surprise for my daughters 21st Birthday. Quite simply, it was the best experience of my life, as well as my daughter. Everyone in the hotel seemed to know it was her birthday. Every member of staff from the concierge, bell boys, staff in the restaurant etc, were wishing her a happy birthday. The staff had managed to coordinate and carry out various orders and deliveries for me and they still gave her 2 small birthday cakes,as well as another one I'd ordered. They were also kind enough to write a birthday card and give her a bottle of champagne in our room. Our room was wonderful and everything was perfect. The only downside to the whole weekend, was the people in the next door room decided to have an all night party. By 3am, I'd had enough and called reception. Security were called and they did keep the noise down a bit but it was still going at 5am. I know this is not the hotels fault but they were kind enough to apologise to me before I got to complain and they've offered us a room upgrade should we visit again. I'm glad to say we are going back in July. This hotel is a must for everyone, at least once in their life.", April 2017, Travelled as a couple

The crustless sandwich tier is what you would expect - ham/cheese/egg/salmon and the cake tier includes macaroons plus other small bites.

baseleysimon,14,8,What you have paid for,[5.0],"We booked a two night stay to celebrate a birthday. It is very hard to find fault, so I won’t try. First of all the staff. They are helpful without being either unctuous or servile. They are there to help you, but they do so as equals, which is exactly how it should be. This was especially true in the restaurant where the service was friendly and efficient and even if they still go in for synchronised lid lifting, even that seemed entirely in keeping with an excellent meal in formal, but unstuffy, surroundings. Our room was an executive double. Hotels of the Ritz’s vintage can often overdo the bedrooms – acres of soft furnishings etc., but they have not made that mistake, thus our room was attractively furnished, without being opulent and airy, without being cavernous.

Now, my brother and I are not posh people, so the inconvenience struck us a virtually nil. Still, we were beyond grateful.The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, and, to a person, the staff were kind and professional, particularly the impeccable waiters serving breakfast.

Service - 5 stars. Food: The food was good. Not exceptional, but good. I enjoyed the sandwiches (which they bring more of without you asking). The scones were more like American biscuits, which wasn't what I expected, but fine. The desserts seemed good, although by the time they came, I was stuffed and couldn't eat much of them. Food - 4 stars. Ambiance: It's the Ritz. Need I say more? I would say the overall ""experience"" is 85% or what you're paying for. Not the food. Ambiance - 5 stars.

I would just add that we have done the rounds of afternoon tea in upmarket places in London and as usual, we stuffed ourselves so full we left no room for the individual cakes. We fully expected, when we asked, that they would be boxed for us to enjoy later as no five star hotel has refused to do this for us in the past. For ""elf"" reasons, this couldn't be done. If the cakes are going to be ""re-cycled"" - surely they wouldn't be thrown away -, it's probably a bigger health risk than letting the guest take them away!!Despite this, we had a great time in a beautiful location with attentive staff and we would recommend the experience to all (just bring an empty tuppaware box along as a guest)", April 2017,nan

AS1744,113,28,A lovely experience ,[5.0],"My husband and I were given champagne afternoon tea at The Ritz as a wedding gift. We didn't realise how difficult it would be to get a booking at a suitable time to have afternoon tea but eventually booked a date in 10 months after the wedding! When we arrived we were surprised at how small the Palm Court was and this is probably one of the reasons why it was so difficult to get a booking. Despite its modest size however, all the tables seemed to be positioned in such a way that all guests could enjoy a level of privacy. We started off with a glass of champagne each and a selection of sandwiches and cakes. We were both surprised at the freshness of the sandwiches and there was plenty of variety for all tastes. When our sandwich levels were low they were quickly refilled by staff. We moved on to scones, both fruit and plain, which were nicely warmed and delicious served with jam and clotted cream. Before we reached the cakes on the top tier of the stand, a trolley with today's selection of cakes was wheeled round. Despite being very full already we couldn't resist the chocolate and pear tart and hazelnut and chocolate cake. Overall the cakes were nice but I would say that they were quite standard for an afternoon tea, and nothing particularly special. Everything was presented beautifully though and the pianist playing throughout the sitting created a very charming, relaxed atmosphere. The staff were fantastic from the outset- they were attentive but not intrusive. They were friendly and happy to offer recommendations from the selections of tea on offer and were experts in photography for the guests! Although I think that the actual food is pretty standard for a hotel afternoon tea, I think it is the ambiance, attention to detail and the staff that makes tea at The Ritz such a lovely experience and one that I will hopefully be lucky enough to do again.", April 2017, Travelled as a couple

It exceeded my expectations beautiful decor relaxed atmosphere. We shared the smoked salmon cones which were amazing washed down with beautiful champagne.To meet Frank Sinartras pianist was amazing he is a musical legend which added to the whole experience being so special.

inlovewithshanghai,20,2,Amazing hotel and experience! A must when visiting London,[5.0],"We stayed for 3 nights and loved everything about this hotel - the history, atmosphere, rooms, furnishing - everything made us feel like we were years away from the present time! The room: The room was very spacious, especially considering how central the hotel is, it is definitely a luxury to stay in a room that big in central London. The bathroom was nice and marbled, they even put a lovely fresh stem of flower by the sink for you. They also had a heated rack for the towels so it was really nice and warm after a long nice shower. I loved the pressure of the shower as well, it was quite strong considering the vintage style. Hot water/ water temperature was consistent throughout the shower and the shampoo and conditioner they provide was really great, I thought it made my hair look and feel better!The location: I cannot think of a better location than where the Ritz was. It was very close to the main shopping street so you can be shopping till you dropped on Regent street, but far enough so that the ""flow of people"" around the hotel wasn't all too overwhelming. There are several restaurants near the hotel and the lovely Green Park is literally beside it - talk about convenience and easy access to the underground (they even have The Ritz marked on the underground exit)!Staff: The staff were friendly and very professional, reception was very efficient, checked in without problems and check out was even smoother! The doormen were all lovely, the attire, smiles, hat, and that special charm when they greet you - oh, they were most consistent in greeting us and we always felt like being transported to another time. The only thing that can be improved is the housekeeping staff, they were perhaps shy, and would almost never greet us if we walk past them. It should also be a practice that they ""knock"" first before opening a room. Once I was by the door checking my outfit in the wardrobe mirror when a male staff just literally unlocked the door and barged into the room, we were both really shocked (good thing I was not naked!) He was very apologetic and speechless and ended up  asking me if there was a ""maid"" in the room - turns out he was supposed to go into the room next door - oops! Service: They were very helpful and responsive when inquiries are made. We have requested to leave our luggage for a week with the hotel upon checkout since we were headed to Scotland and they gladly assisted us. We were really impressed and appreciated their service considering we left quite a few things. Although one point to improve is greater attention to small details - we availed to have the daily telegraph delivered to the room each morning, however, we only received it on one occasion. This is not really a big deal for me, but I would just expect greater attention to detail from such a hotel.Overall the stay was nothing short of amazing and we are glad we chose to stay at the Ritz! We definitely look forward to staying here again - we can't wait to be back in a few days time and we'll try the breakfast this time :)", April 2017, Travelled with family
WayfarerDXB,108,14,Excellence to be expected!!!,[4.0],"The Ritz is truly an institution.  My wife and I spent 3 nights here in March.  Everything was great from the car door onward.  We were upgraded and everyone was beyond helpful.   The hotel thinks of everything and may have even controlled the weather, sunny and warm London for 3 days in March....It is the perfect place for a little luxury and shopping in London.  With the lower value in the pound also good value.  The only part that I do like about the hotel is that breakfast is quite stuffy....  and also should have coffee and tea in the room.  I have noticed this missing in other grand hotels and find it cheeky to pay to order up at those hotel rates...Even though we had breakfast included we elected for Pret A Manger takeaway from down the street the other days and ate in the room with the news, and over priced coffee 😊That said, still highly recommended.", March 2017, Travelled as a couple
tashajo-ann,18,12,Elegance and luxury ,[5.0],"My partner and I have just returned from a one night stay at The Ritz to celebrate my birthday. We had booked early and got a very good rate on a queen sized room through trip advisor. The hotel had noted it was my birthday and emailed a week in advance to advise of extras available for the celebration, as we had booked a pre theatre dinner reservation my partner added a cake to it. Check in was at 2pm but we advised them that we would be in London earlier and they offered to get the room ready asap, no extra charge and the store luggage etc whilst we looked around London. As soon as we arrived staff were extremely attentive and friendly, the grandeur of the place and the beautiful surroundings felt almost overwhelming but the staff were never pompous, just polite, happy and all wished me a happy birthday at every opportunity! I felt very special, the staff got our room ready asap, much earlier than we anticipated and we were greeted with (another) complimentary birthday cake and card. The room was gorgeous, perfectly spacious as was the separate marble bathroom, which unfortunately had a shower only. The luggage was swiftly bought up and more services offered and explained such as clothes pressing, room service etc. On check in we were asked if we wanted to make a table booking for the rivoli bar before our meal, I'm pleased we did. The bar was like stepping back in time, glamorous and classy with exceptional service and complimentary birthday drinks! The meal was also as I expected, top class service, food was delicious and I was glad I dressed up for the occasion. We then went to Covent Garden and watched the woman in black-brilliant play. So thank you to all the staff at The Ritz for making my birthday stay so special, unforgettable with many small touches from start to finish that give you the status you deserve.", April 2017, Travelled as a couple

Lars_Krull,160,117,Recommended place in London - Just go and see for yourselves,[5.0],"This was our first visit to the Ritz London and as well the first trip with our children (12 and 13 yrs) to London, where we have been many times before!We booked a family package where we all (4) were to stay in a junior suite where the sofa was converted into one bed (sofabad) and another extra bed were installed as well!  The suite is very nice equipped and everything you need is there right at your hands. On this travel I had to work from time to time, but the writing desk is that low and the chair that high that you cannot have your own legs there and sitting well (Room 316), I think that the hotel very well can maintain the style and décor but have some more work-like writing desks. Wifi is all over the hotel and is inclusive (ofcourse). We booked a family package (breakfast inclusive and all in one room) for 4 nights.We arrived at night about 21:30 at the reception staff were very nice and since we had not got dinner they arranged that a table in the RIVOLI BAR were ready for the four of us. We got a nice bar dinner (Club Sandwiches and a Burger), which were presented and served in the very best manner!Arriving at our room (first time after the bar dinner) we came to a nice equipped room of ample size! However with the 2 extra “sleeps” the room feels somewhat crampy when made ready for sleep! As a curiosity our luggage first arrived at the room when we came back from the bar (where we spent abot 60 minutes) we usually let porters/doorman take care of our luggage and bring to our room – If we not have gone to the bar for late dinner such a wait time would not have been acceptable (at ADLON, Berlin sometimes the luggage is up before you) – I do not know why it was that slow? As a frequent hotel guest I am normally very observant of work load for staff at any time – Here Sunday at 22:00 it was easy to see that no one were overburdened.We had a perfect sleep and the breakfast in the restaurant is served in a courteous manner and the selection is good and the food quality in top. We had booked for Afternoon tea Monday (the next day) for 15:30 – During our breakfast we could see that time would make our plans for our stay more difficult – On our way back to our rooms we asked the reception if tea time could be changed to 19:30 (same day)? And here you really feel that they do what every they can for guests staying at the hotel, we got the time changed!After a day of doing sightseeing and shopping we dressed up for the Ritz Afternoon tea – What a nice experience, the right service at the right spot. Sandwiches, scones and cakes all were perfect. Please do as we did – start with a nice glass of champagne! The afternoon tea is a must go and must do – The staff serving the tea is very aware that you are a (resident) guest and will address you with your name! (nice manners always pay off). Afternoon tea more than makes up for a dinner (so scrap lunch AND dinner the day you go for afternoon tea).We also booked a table for a 20:00 sitting in the Ritz Restaurant (Wednesday) and I really felt that the headwaiter took extremely well care of us – My wife and I were served a very good menu with a superb selection of different wines, you can of course choose wines from the wine list by glass or bottle – but usually the sommelier at restaurants of this class (Michelin*) can do a very good selection job that you cannot even match yourselves. Our kids of 12 and 13 yrs ordered from the children’s menu! It was a joy for us that the waiters took the serving job for them as serious as they did for us – They are well behaved and we take them to the same restaurants as we go to and we expect that we can get something that they like, which the Ritz Restaurant more than lived up to! (Thank you). The headwaiter also made us feel very welcome as staying guests.As earlier described we stayed at the Ritz for 4 nights and if I should make any recommendation you should always go for at least two nights, if you are to sample both the Ritz Restaurant dinner (Michelin*) and the afternoon tea – Do the tea the day after you arrive and the Ritz Restaurant the night before you leave! And I do recommend that you also take a bar dinner in the RIVOLI BAR.Staying at the Ritz you can use you bathing facilities in your room as you desire – in connection with the turndown the bathroom and towels will be reinstated. For us being 4 in the room with the extra bed being there all day, made the room less “stayable” during the day, which again made us more out of the room  - which I feel reduced the business opportunities (selling more food and bar services to us) for the hotel. Maybe the hotel should consider offering a connecting room to the suite for a good (extra) price? I am sure that we would have spent more at the hotel!Ritz is a hotel with old fashioned keys that you return every time you go out – and you really feel they know you, since coming back you just asks for you key and you will get it. (One time I was asked to tell my name, and the concierge checked his computer if that matched the room number). You really feel that security is very well taken care of! A couple of times I did ask the various concierges of travel advice in connection to our sightseeing transport needs – They are very polite, but they seem to have too much to do, since they both acts as concierges and as the hand-in and hand-out function of keys which often is done by receptions. Being busy often gives the guest the feeling as being “not desired”! Ritz is a small hotel compared to our Berlin Favorite ADLON – And you feel at home and everyone will do the outmost to make you feel welcome and when possible they will address you with your name!I do recommend staying at Ritz – If you are in for a treat please stay as I recommend above!  For my selves, I would certainly consider this hotel as my hotel when going to London for business on my own! But I am still puzzled if Ritz is a place for a treat or for business as well (See above about the writing desk) – If its for the treat I am certainly recommending this place!", April 2017, Travelled with family

The reception check in is friendly and efficient though it could perhaps be provided with seating for the checkin process. We were impressed by the consistent warmth and friendliness of every member of staff that we met. The only minor negative observation was the breakfast buffet which lacked style in presentation whilst table service might have been a bit more prompt. Why do hotels of this quality require guests to get up and down to access their breakfast?!

Andrew D,39,28,Faded grandeur,[3.0],"The last time we were in London we stayed at the Savoy which was outstanding, and I believe is probably one of the best hotels in London if not the world. Having never stayed at the Ritz before we decided to book for two nights in March when in the UK for a wedding. Obviously the Ritz is a grand old lady and a London institution. We had very high expectations which unfortunately were left wanting in some regards. The staff were, without exception, friendly and attentive and could not be faulted in their professionalism. The building itself is beautifully decorated in the public areas, especially the palm court. Our room however was looking tired and in desperate need of renovation. The decor in our room was obviously ""classic"" but the little details were lacking and there were some glaring problems that had clearly been overlooked for some time. There was a hole in the wall behind the bedside light fitting, the desk was scratched and chipped, the cushions on the chairs looked about 30 years old, the wood-effect minibar looked of a similar vintage, the wall-mounted shower head in the bathroom was woeful and again looked like it had been there since the 80s. Despite it being a cold March in London, the room felt stuffy to the point we had to run the air conditioning almost constantly. This blows out from vents behind the curtains and is great at making them fly about, but no so effective at keeping the temperature comfortable. Our main concern was that clearly somebody had been smoking if not in our room then in one of the adjacent rooms. A scent-diffuser was plugged in on the floor in the corridor outside our room and produced an overpoweringly sickly sweet artificial aroma which, when turned off, revealed a noticeable smell of cigarette smoke which we could both also smell on our pillows at night.I feel that if you are paying several hundred pounds a night for five star service, you might want to look at staying elsewhere until the Ritz gets some serious money spent on bringing rooms like the one we stayed in into the 21st century! I appreciate the ""old world charm"" of classic hotels like the Ritz, but there needs to be modernisation where it is needed and unfortunately, judging from our room at least, this appears to be about 20 years overdue. Will definitely stick to the Savoy next time!", March 2017, Travelled as a couple

mellamike,105,52,Not up to my expectations,[3.0],"Over the past few years I have taken advantage of special deals offered by some of London's finest hotels ,usually 3 for 2 in a suite in the low season .Last time was the savoy Riverview suite .This time the Ritz in an executive suite .The Ritz is a piece of London's history ,an iconic hotel and one that I was looking forward to taking my wife to as a surprise .Unbeknown to us our arrival time coincided with the St Patrick day parade and the whole area around the hotel was blocked .Our driver spent an hour driving round attempting to find a way to the Ritz .We ended up having to walk with bags ,cases and clothes carriers a considerable distance to the hotel ..I asked the hotel management why they did not inform us (others )that problems beyond their control would make access to the hotel problematic and was told they have a policy not to contact guests in case they get annoyed .It seems they prefer not to allow you to make alternative arrangements (Green Park Tube ) and are happier for you to arrive really ,really annoyed .The suite was fine ,not stunning or magnificent ,words I have used when reviewing some other hotels .There was no view of any note from the room although the Ritz can not change its location .There was  a very welcome bottle of champagne and small cake  from the hotel for which I thank them very much .There was no tea/ coffee making facilities or tooth brushes/tooth paste provided .Small points but things I take for granted in such prestigious hotels   I To be fair I am probably not the ideal  Ritz guest  .I have no interest in eating in Gourmet style restaurants and afternoon tea in not my scene .For those people who want to do this (I am certainly in the minority )I would think they would have a wonderful time at this hotel .When leaving other hotels after similar short stays we have come away feeling pampered and looking forward to returning .With the Ritz excellent though it is in many ways we just felt this was just one of London's hotels ,nothing special .The only time (apart from check in and check out )we were referred to by name was at breakfast when the waiter apologised about getting the order wrong  Despite these negative points ,and obviously these are purely subjective views ,I would say value for money was good .I  consider £730 p.n.for 3 nights a very fair price for this type of London hotel .Last year the savoy charged the same but this year was over twice as much and other top hotels usually start at around £1000 p.n. ..", March 2017, Travelled as a couple

enbonespoyr,36,9,Afternoon Tea Treat,[5.0],"This was a great Christmas present from my son, yes, I did have to wait until March, but it was definitely worth the wait and the feeling of anticipation and expectation added to the experience.Great fun to get dressed up and spend the day in London. There is a strict dress code so to avoid disappointment enter fully into the spirit of the experience and get on your best togs! As we had arrived a little early we went into the bar for pink champagne and cocktails which were served with some good nibbles. Be warned you do need to put aside more than a few pounds but for me it was a once in a life time experience so we made the most of it!We then had more champagne with our afternoon tea. The tea menu was extensive and even satisfied my taste in healthy teas. The food was good and replenished as we needed it, we definitely didn't go hungry. As well as cakes being served with the sandwiches there was also a cake trolley circulating the room at regular intervals. The bread was good and the fillings very acceptable. I wasn't over awed by the cakes as I had expected to be. Re my personal taste the cakes are something they could improve on. Maybe some tiny Viennese Fingers, some mini double chocolate brownies and some delicate french patisserie tarts. The scones were 100% great! There was plenty of lovely thick cream and jam for us all.The hotel is beautiful and the flowers were stunning. All staff were courteous and polite at all times.Following our afternoon tea we spent some happy hours shopping in Covent Garden followed by watching , ""The Lady in Black,"" which was also a great experience.A good day out was had by all.", March 2017, Travelled with family

Versican3,16,18,Unparalleled service,[5.0],"Everyone knows The Ritz London.  Everyone knows it's the top.  I knew what I was gonna get taken care of before I even arrived.  Still The Ritz London managed to leave me speechless with its unparalleled service.Location:5/5Perfect for just about everything.  This trip was a touch and go 24 hour transit/shopping stop.  It fits perfectly into the Piccadilly-Regent street/Soho-Oxford street-New/Old Bond street loop.  Previously I also enjoyed a casual walk down from Green Park to Buckingham Palace/Westminster.  Not to mention a lovely stroll to Hyde Park and Harrod's.  It's also right next to Green Park station, which is on the Piccadilly line straight from Heathrow-not that the majority of Ritz's limo-taking guests care...First impression 5/5My first encounter was before I was even physically there.  I e-mailed them and ask if they can receive a few parcels for me, and they promptly replied with an OK.  I know it's quite common these days but still a brownie point for them.  When I finally arrived, being synonymous to luxury and prestige, I found the entry to Ritz surprisingly modest.  However, the magic started from the first moment I made eye contact with the bell captain.  Everything just happened so effortlessly and before I knew it, my luggage was taken care off and I was ushered all the way to check-in.Check-in 5/5The girls at the desk were simply delightful.  one of them took me for a little tour of the lobby and restaurants and escorted me all the way up to my room.  Although this is the normal now for high end hotels, I still appreciated the tour.  Also by the time I got to my room, the parcels I had asked them to receive for me were already waiting for me in my room along with my luggage.  Room/amenities: 4/5The room itself looks a bit dated but still in good condition.  The bed is a bit saggy-maybe some people prefer it but it felt just a bit well-used.  Loved the free smartphone though!!  If I had known I wouldn't have roamed while I was in London!  It was a bit slow but hey it was free and had all the nice apps and info on it.  Very convenient.  The only bone to pick was the lack of mouthwash-I was quite surprised when I was told by Housekeeping that they didn't offer that.  Other services:Because of my tight schedule, I didn't have time to enjoy any of the restaurants this time.  I did order some room service: a lobster club sandwich and some side fries- delicious as they were, the serving size was really on the small side. A bowl of chips had probably 8 strings.  So if you are hungry then better order more.Overall:5/5A short but utterly delightful stay.  Splendid decoration aside, what made my trip enjoyable was the people.  Their customer service was just top notch.  I don't know how they did it but everyone seemed to remember my name and the way they interacted with guests was- not too formal, not too flippant -just right.  There is a reason why Ritz continues to thrive when there are so much competition in London.", March 2017, Travelled solo

Nothing is too much trouble and you feel well and truly looked after . What especially stands out is regardless of background all guests are shown the same first class service without being pretentious.The warm friendly greeting we got from the door staff as we arrived  set the high standard from the beginning . I can't remember the gentlemans name but he remembered our names throughout our stay and was full of personality.  He is an asset to this hotel and made us laugh as well as making us feel so welcome.  You will see him in the photos I have added.

We decided, after a nano second, that this would be the perfect opportunity to fulfil a dream and stay there as well.  I have to say it was one of the better decisions we've made.  We booked an Executive King and we felt it was excellent value.   We were expecting a little stuffiness but The Ritz is anything but that.  All the staff we dealt with were professional and pleasant and went out of their way to make our stay the very best it could be and they certainly succeeded.Everything about our stay was faultless.  We missed out on the full welcome at check in, but only because our friends had chosen that exact time to arrive as well so lots of tears and kisses.  Finally they went off to enjoy their afternoon tea and we went up to our room which was so much better, bigger and more beautiful than we expected.  They somehow have managed to create a comfortable space but none of the 2k essentials have been forgotten. The wifi is fast and reliable. The room was really spacious and the turn down service had the added touch of covering the beautiful fabric headboard with a monogrammed linen piece, what a great idea.  The bathroom was huge, full size bath, seperate shower, decent quality amenities and good lighting, what more could we want?We were only able to stay one night, but since then we're planning another trip to London just to stay again.PS A very minor point - as a very early riser I would have loved tea and coffee facilities in the room.", November 2016, Travelled as a couple

Ruth M,5,2,Putting on The Ritz,[5.0],"Booked this package for 1 night, 20th March for my 50th. One night accommodation with breakfast, champagne in room and Afternoon Tea (booked 7.30pm sitting). From start to finish this was amazing. A Birthday cake was waiting for me along with the champagne in our room. (we both smoke so were allocated the 3rd floor though we only had one cigarette as it didn't feel right smoking in a room!) We don't like fancy teas and I was a little nervous, I asked for normal tea, the waiter put us at ease by saying, 'shall we keep this simple Madam', I then relaxed!!! More sandwiches were brought and then an extra few (my husband loved the cheese ones) the pianist then played Happy Birthday and another cake was brought to me. I couldn't eat another thing and asked if the cake could be sent to our room. Not a problem. Had a cocktail in the bar, didn't catch the names of the two lads in there but they were both Spanish and lovely. The only down side was at checkout. I knew I had been over charged but didn't have the courage to say anything. (I had been charged for afternoon tea when it was already included in the package) I did phone today and as soon as they looked at the details they could see straight away it was the case. Refunded immediately. Mistakes are made, we are only human. I cannot fault the service of the staff here and the 2 doormen were so funny and polite.

aprilterri,43,6,Pre-Mother's Day Afternoon Tea,[5.0],"Being Londoners we have passed The Ritz thousands of times but had no reason to venture within. However, this year I decided to treat my mother to Afternoon Tea as an early Mothers Day Present. I booked a few months in advance via bookatable. Card details were taken (whilst booking online) but the payment is actually taken on the day.  We entered the building and were directed down the hall by the doorman. We firstly placed our coats in the cloakroom (this is complimentary) and then went downstairs to the 'Powder room'. After which we came back up and checked in with a lovely man whose name that we didn't catch (if staff are reading he was there around 7.30pm Monday 20th March checking people in via an iPad please offer him our thanks) he made us feel very welcome. We informed him that my sister would be late and that we would start without her and he assured us that he would refresh our food when she arrived. We were shown to our table and our waiter, Simon introduced himself. He was very friendly, attentive but never intrusive. We took his suggestion of the Ritz Royale Blend and later I tried the chocolate Mint Robios, which I liked so much that I asked hims whether I could purchase a tin. The tin cost £15 and holds 106g. A reasonable price in my opinion, for a rare tea blend. We had booked via an offer which entitled us to 15% off if the afternoon tea (making it £45pp) this was discreetly added to our bill. We were starving when we arrived so probably ate more than most but our food was replenished without judgement. The pianist was great and played some recognisable tunes.If management see this please forward to your staff that we felt welcomed by them all and received great service.

We weren't disappointed because when we got home & tasted the raspberry and fresh cream it was sensational. The waiters who served us were brilliant and couldn't do enough for us. From start to finish we had an amazing time I'd thoroughly recommend it. After we ate we had a cheeky look in The Ritz jewellery shop, we explained we just wanted to have a look & were presented with a lovely response from a nice lady & gentlemen who let us look around. Only slight let down was the desk staff on reception who seemed quite standoffish when we enquired where to go for afternoon tea.", March 2017, Travelled with family

I explained I was having difficulty securing a reservation for afternoon tea in a few weeks times and they saw to it that I had a table. The room was immaculate and the afternoon tea was the best I have experienced in London, as it always is, and best value for money.

destressing,182,76,So much more than just a hotel,[5.0],"The Ritz is about a special treat and a wonderful experience and we felt that way from the moment we arrived.  Everyone involved made us feel so welcome but weren't 'over the top'.  On arrival we were presented with a beautiful book about the hotel for my husbands retirement surprise experience. There is somehow a feeling that you are being greeted into a private home which is most comforting amidst all the sparking chandeliers, the grand sweep of the main staircase and fine French classical style.Dinner was a delight, having reviewed the 85 page wine list before arriving and celebrating in traditional style.  Champagne is a must.  Another must for us were  Crepe Suzettes which were prepared by Gabriel.......although we did have a giggle when he said this was his first time, clearly it wasn't and hence why he needed the fire blanket to hand!  If you are staying,  a trip into the Club is a must just to see the beautiful setting.  Just sign in,  no need to gamble. A special door leads you down a grand staircase  to the hotel's former Ballroom.We sat outside The Rivoli Bar at 11.30 pm with distant laughter and a calm quiet few minutes reflecting on the wonderful day we had before retiring.Many visitors had left and for us this was a peaceful few minutes in such a beautiful setting.Credit to everyone involved in making The Ritz so very special.

From the top of that grand staircase, to the lovely rooms (I started in the smallest and have inched my way up), everything is a treat for the eyes. The food is wonderful and the location ideal. But, of course, what makes the Ritz the Ritz is the staff.  From top to bottom they are helpful, kind and charming. They have made me feel like family.

Its ground floor is busy with tourists taking tea (11hr30 to 19hr30).  The bedroom had not been turned-down by 21hr00.  Dispite advance notice a room was not available on arrival at mid-day.  My baggage was not removed from my room at 10 as agreed and was left in my room (causing a rushed and confused departure at 13hr00).The bathroom bars of soap are vintage 1906, hard, scentless and useless.

Its the little touches such as the staff remembering your name, taking you on a guided tour of the hotel should you wish and just being happy to help with absolutely anything that you could think of that makes this hotel better than anywhere else I've stayed. My husband and I have just returned from a 2 week all inclusive holiday at a top hotel in Mexico and I can honestly say I enjoyed our two night stay at The Ritz more! I dont think I can say any more than that. The only reason that I didnt score this hotel a 5* was because we were woken in the early morning,both mornings,by the bin lorry emptying the bottle recycling! Fortunately we managed to go back to sleep but it was still not what we expected mfrom the hotel (maybe an arrangement with the recycling company to empty the bins during the day for this hotel would have made more sense).", March 2017, Travelled as a couple

JonathonCuff,156,43,Tips for Ritz diners - on a budget (yes really).,[5.0],"If you're a regular Ritz customer or are happy with the sort of menu that doesn't have a price then this review is not for you.On the other hand if you don't have the luxury of being able to be so indifferent to such a tawdry thing as money then this might help.So.  We enjoy eating out and we are prepared to pay for quality - to a point and this is what this review is about.The Ritz is, for me, one of THE best places in London to enjoy proper fine dining, listening to a piano player or quintet whilst bathing in old world hospitality and charm.  But we don't have money to just throw around willy nilly (that's a English term for without thinking)>My tip, and the point of this review, is to look at the deals that TimeOut and The Ritz run from time to time which offer a more restricted menu but at a significantly reduced price (£59 per head last night excluding coffee).Are you treated like a second class diner - we've been four, maybe five times now and the answer is absolutely not.  Aside from the different menu you chose from at the beginning there's no distinction I could see.Service is, well it's what most other restaurants should aspire to.  I've yet to dine anywhere else where they a) have a record of your allergies; b) respond to them as if it's the most normal thing in the world; and c) take great care to explain what you are eating and also pride in what they are serving.Yes it's not to everyones taste, yes it is still expensive but for that special occasion it's very hard to beat.  Not all prospective diners will like the dress code - jacket and tie for men - but that's also part of the appeal for me, it means you make an effort.If in London, treat yourself (if you have the above jacket and tie as I'm not sure they have ones to loan).Two more tips:1.  If on the special offer, ask to see the vegetarian menu because it's different and in our case last night, had an extra desert which two of us chose - and again the order was taken without batting an eyelid.2.  Deserts:  they will have a souffle on the menu.  Order it (and ask for a small spoon to eat it with).  Almost worth the price of the meal on its own apparently (I have always found other dishes to tempt me and have not had a souffle yet).Hope this is instructive.", February 2017, Travelled with friends

And so they should be in such magnificent surroundings. It all added to the overall experience as did the 5 piece band opposite the tea room and also the solo pianist. TerrificOn to the restaurant, which was a rather large and, I believe, a period room with fantastic chandeliers and furniture to match. The greeting, the sommelier and all the waiters were knowledgeable, pleasant, very helpful and of course incredibly efficient. The three course meal and also the vegetarian three course meal were superb.A true experience, which I would have rated 5* but for the fact that the strict dress code ( nothing really wrong with that) did make me feel a little uneasy whilst clearly the restaurant was mainly full of tourists, which, also, to my mind, did not lend itself to a truly intimate evening.

The cakes and sandwiches were served, all were really nicely presented and could be replenished if needed, the only negative for me was the selection of cakes were not all to my taste and as an English tradition it would have been nice to have a Victoria sponge amongst them. The trolley of cake that came round after included Pear tart and chocolate and hazelnut sponge, this was a nice addition. Yes, the afternoon tea here is pricey but, it is an experience not just a cup of tea and some cake!

Going into the amazing room, seeing the cake and other treats for her, she was almost in tears, tears of joy.Going there with a small child we decided to do room service for dinner and was very impressed with the food and service. We decided to have breakfast downstairs and thought that was very good too,The only little area of concern was when we came downstairs for a drink (a cocktail) we called before and asked whether we needed to book a table in the lounge. We were told we didn't need to. When we came to the lounge, we had to wait for a while whilst a seat could be found.

Frenchfile,110,67,Ritz Cracker- The best hotel-The Savoy doesn't even compare which says something,[5.0],"I have always wanted to stay at The Ritz since my Dad took me for drinks when I was about 12 years old. I have subsequently had some fun afternoons in the Rivoli Bar, but this weekend I finally got to stay. We arrived and our car and luggage were promptly and deftly dealt with, we checked in and were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Deluxe Suite over looking Green Park and Piccadilly. I am an interior design sucker and I was genuinely blown away by the charm and grace of the rooms. The decor is reminiscent of a French Chateau, romantic, utterly charming and genuine. I have seen other reviewers say The Ritz needs up dating I vehemently disagree it is truly beautiful, opulent, timeless if you want gizmos and in your face technology then maybe choose somewhere else. I am lucky enough to have stayed at The Savoy a few times and it becomes something of a faux pastiche of a grand dame hotel when compared to The Ritz. There is nothing ubiquitous about The Ritz, it is unique with a real sense of style and tradition which can't be imitated, there is something so refreshing about the hotel that doesn't try to decorate or refurb in the same manner as all the rest. I loved the traditional curtains, soft furnishings and elegant furnishings, its exudes quality and refinement that totally fits with the surroundings.We decided to nip into the Rivoli Bar for lunch (currently relocated to a smaller room whilst the bar is being refurbished) but this in no way spoiled the experience. Discreet pleasant service a wonderful sea food platter with lobster, oysters, prawns etc all presented and cooked to perfection washed down with a marvellous Chablis. Then we just went up stairs and enjoyed the suite and what a truly wonderful place to spend time in. Not only were we upgraded we were also given a complimentary bottle of Champagne and some lovely fruit which was much appreciated, thank you. I loved the sitting room, opulent carpet and furnishings with a superb sound system.The bathroom was well appointed and I loved the arm rests in the bath as an avid reader it makes a change for me not to end up with a soggy book. One constructive criticism is in the bathroom, as all the fittings are gold it would be an idea to have a gold bin and stool to match rather than chrome, that is me being ultra picky. The toiletries were lovely and plentiful. We went out for dinner but found all the staff on return really friendly and helpful the whole hotel just makes you feel really at home and relaxed, how do they remember all the guests by name?The bed was so comfy and vast. Housekeeping have to be congratulated the place is gleaming, totally immaculate, I have a dust allergy and I am normally always sneezing wherever I go. Not one sneeze the whole stay- how is that even possible? The bed was so comfortable, exquisite linen, once again I can find no fault. On to breakfast: the dining room is very impressive as is the breakfast offering and service, it needs to be experienced. To top it all off we watched Roger Federer win the Aussie Open before leaving-perhaps The Ritz even arranged that. Ok I have to stop now because I could go on and on about how much I loved everything about my stay so Thank you so much-just wish I could afford to live at The Ritz left feeling so relaxed and happy and you can't ask for more than that.

Beautiful building which absolutely reeks of a bye gone era, when customer service and exceeding expectations was quite simply the norm! The reception staff were extremely friendly and efficient and this level of customer service just kept on coming! Rooms to be honest are a little tired, but everything works in abundance! You get a beautiful room key, not a cheap plastic programmed entry card, the hot water in the bathroom is plentiful, on demand and works with incredible pressure, proper light switches, not iPad controlled ones! Everything you would expect from a Grand Hotel whose reputation goes before it. Practically everything is embossed with the 'Ritz' logo, even the tissues in the room! Within minutes all the staff know who you are, incredible given the size of the property! Breakfast was a delight in the Ritz dining room as was the 'Live at The Ritz' dinner and dance on the Saturday night, which was accompanied by an excellent band and singer, and some amazing professional dancing, by a couple who showed us the best of The Argentinian Tango, The Rumba, The Salsa and The Quick Step to name but a few. You really do sit in their dining room and get transported back to another, far more gracious and elegant period in time. Everything is oh so slick and polished!The Ritz totally exceeded our expectations, yes there are some niggles, the Rivoli Bar being closed for renovation was one of them, the temporary Bar facilities being very poor,  but look past these, relax and allow the elegance, beauty and graciousness of the property and it's heritage to transport you back to a world that has fast become forgotten!

Millimole,141,89,Afternoon Tea - a great treat,[4.0],"We were bought 'Afternnon Tea at The Ritz' as a special birthday treat. We came here on a Saturday afternoon at about 3:30pm.I feel a bit mean not giving this luxury event a five star rating, but a couple of minor issues pulled it down a bit.We arrived a little before our booked time, and once our coats were safely stored in the cloakroom, we were promptly shown to our table. Once seated we were plied with never ending plates of little sandwiches- don't underestimate these - they are incredibly filling, and very, very nice. There is a huge choice of teas, if you get the chance to select one before you go, then you will be better placed. My wife chose her favourite Russian Caravan Tea, and I tried a new one for me Rose Congou - both were excellent.After the sandwiches came the little cakes - frankly these were a little disappointing- rather bland, and somewhat over-sweet. After the little cakes, came the scones, with cream and jam - again, very very nice - but by this time I was feeling rather stuffed! And then came the cake trolley, with a choice of cake by the slice - these were very nice, but the choice was two different types of chocolate cake, and I'm unusual in that I don't like chocolate. Apart from the disappointing little cakes, there were a couple of other niggles - the seating was a little cramped, not uncomfortable, but noticeable; the teapots in use let the tea get cool rather quickly, leading to a stewed taste; and there was a lot of noise (where we were) making the pianist superfluous. It's disappointing that uneaten little cakes can't be taken away.The staff were and helpful, even if they were a bit hard to hear on occasions.

A wonderful afternoon and thankfully a very memorable one for all the right reasons. Special thanks to the waiter who took our photographs and made us laugh and smile . You're a little treasure.

We were ushered in the Magnificent tea rooms with it decadent décor. Staff cant do enough for your helped mum up and down the stairs. The pianist what can I say wonderful made a fuss of Mum and played some of her requests and believe it or not worked as Frank Sinatras  pianist for 10 years, made her day. The only negative is Mum would have like to have taken some of the cakes home with her in a little box to share with friends, we were told this was not possible. unfortunate really as Ive had afternoon tea in a lot of other places and this is facilitated, after all you have paid for it.", January 2017, Travelled with family

Was the boyfriends birthday and they bought him a little cake with a candle, I hadn't told them it was his birthday they had just overheard our conversation, they couldn't have been more helpful. Dress code for dinner is smart, tie is mandatory but if you didn't have one they will lend you one (£20 deposit). £6 for a bottle of water for the table. Paid a set price for the 3 course meal, bar prices are high so when we were a bit early for our reservation we went to the bar across the street and had a beer and a glass of wine for less than a tenner.

It's home for me, very personalized service and especially concierge, doorman greeting and welcoming us watmly in and out of the hotel and rushing to give us a hand with our bags. Just a bit disappointed with the unprofessional Franchesca and Franchesco at the breakfast restaurant. They were giggling and sizing us up as soon as we entered and we asked to be seated to another table by the window. They automatically said that there is no table available but we insisted and they had to prepare a table in less than two minutes! We were too busy with our schedules to even have time to complain and speak to the supervisor or hotel manager. Anyway, i will still be back again as my overall experience was pleasant.

Horus13,167,34,Happy Holidays!,[5.0],"Stayed for four nights in December for the holidays. The main reason I chose this hotel is to check off my bucket list to stay at a 5 star hotel - It was decked out for the holidays (see photos). A huge tree in the lobby, decorations throughout the foyer and tea room. Even the smallest room, which I stayed in, was much larger and comfortable than most London hotels. Very clean and the bathroom has all the amenities.A special perk is that a guest is allowed to use a smart phone for free and to take it with them to use like a personal phone. Example: finding the quickest route to a destination, look up websites, transport maps/schedules and make FREE calls to the United States and certain other countries.Every afternoon and early evening they had a six piece choir with pianist singing Christmas Carols in the foyer which adjoined the tea room.Service was exceptional. The mattress was well worn and I was surprised it hadn't been replaced. The very next day they did something - replace/exchange? - that made it much more comfortable. The only room complaint is that the furniture is very Louis painted repro 1960's style furniture. Furniture could be replaced but shouldn't need to close the hotel for four years like the Paris Ritz did.Every detail was attended to. Fresh fruit in the room. Personal Birthday cake upon arrival. Slippers/robes. Mini-bar functioned well to keep my medicine cool. The only complaint is that the taxis charge more 75 to Heathrow then what a normal ride 45 from Heathrow.  If you want a luxury experience and close to all the shopping this is it!  Metro is literally a few hundred yards down the street.", December 2016, Travelled solo

Agathaisthebest,257,65,Lovely Stay,[5.0],"Stayed at The Ritz for a family 18th. Lovely experience from the great check in service including both rooms being upgraded to junior suite. The hotel was stunningly decorated for Christmas, very magical. The suites were beautiful spacious & well appointed. As always in the older style hotels there are never enough plug points by the bed & dressing tables. Bathroom was also well appointed with lovely toiletries & lots of towels. Lovely plush slippers & bathrobes. However the shower was tricky to use & quite stiff. Also kept having to adjust control whilst in the shower as the temperature kept dropping. The following morning we were surprised with a birthday cake & chocolates to our suite- what a lovely touch!

VegasToEssex,732,386,A Decadent (and Expensive) Stay,[4.0],"My husband surprised me with a night's stay at the Ritz in December.  Stating that the hotel is gorgeous would be a massive understatement.  The lobby was decorated perfectly for Christmas, and the front desk staff were incredibly professional and friendly.  I was a little surprised at the deposit amount that the hotel required for incidentals upon check in - it was more than our room!  It also took 30 minutes for the hotel to deliver my bag once I checked in, which was a bit excessive.  We greatly appreciated the complimentary fruit tray upon arrival though. We stayed in an executive king room, which was quite spacious.  It has a separate seating area, a fireplace, and a large desk.  We had a small balcony that overlooked the main street.  The bathroom was massive, although I was a little disappointed at the small size of the shower.  The toilet was also a bit fussy to flush.  Design-wise, the room was definitely ""oldy worldly.""  Perhaps the room could use a slight touch up to make it a bit more modern, but that's just my taste.  The bed was quite comfortable, but we found the room slightly stuffy at night.I took my mother to the afternoon tea earlier in the day, which was absolutely spectacular.  It's worth every single penny.  We also enjoyed the bar prior to leaving for our Christmas party.I'm thrilled that I was able to spend a night at the Ritz, but it was incredibly expensive.  Given the expense plus the older style of the rooms, I think I would try another luxury hotel in London the next time we enjoy a city break.", December 2016, Travelled as a couple

The waiters were not intrusive and very helpful, not at all arrogant - which can happen in some quality establishments. The food was lovely and even though it didn't look like huge portions, we were full at the end of it. It took over 2.5hours start to finish! The cheese selection and discussion was an art form in itself! Would definitely go back - though I understand before Christmas it is a little hectic so maybe go early in that season or wait until after the New Year as we did.

claytoncast,155,191,Fab but sadly not perfect,[4.0],"London undoubtedly has some of the greatest hotels in the world. The downside of actually living in London is that one doesn’t get to stay in the. Twelve  years ago on moving into our first flat together, my partner and I had a night at the Savoy while our new boiler was being put in and we had no hot water. It was a real treat.So as part of the celebrations of our 20th anniversary, I booked a night at the Ritz.It felt slightly wicked and naughty to be arriving at the world’s most famous hotel on a wintry Sunday afternoon to check-in. Thanks to the kind person at the Ritz who had arranged the booking for me, we were upgraded to a suite. It was a little like stepping back in time. The hotel certainly has that feeling when you step into it. The staff greet you at every turn, and check-in was exceptionally personal and very good. As you are accompanied to the lift, you realise that this is as much a tourist attraction as a hotel. Packed with people taking afternoon tea, or people who just come to have a drink in the building, it certainly is one of the most famous places in London.Our suite is fabulously spacious. A little like a favourite aunt’s sitting room from a bygone age it has to be said, but cosy. Beautifully huge pillows on the king-size bed.  good quality TV with sky box, large bathroom, and a mobile phone for the use of guests while they are there which gives you free local and international calls and constant Internet and data - I should imagine exceptionally useful for foreign visitors, although we can’t resist ringing my partner’s parents on it.We head out into London to the cinema for the afternoon and return to spend an hour or so in the suite before going down for dinner. Having been shown the room on check-in, it wasn’t pointed out to us where the heating is, and it takes quite a while to find the control panel. On raising the temperature, the heaters in the corner just blow out cold air and make quite a bit of noise.Dinner in the restaurant (jacket and tie required - hardly a dress code for the 21st-century, but quaintly reflecting the massively over-the-top decor of the room) is a treat. The food is fabulous, and the service is attentive to the point of obsequiousness. We spend time trying to work out the rankings of the waiters according to the colour of their waistcoats, some red, some white, and some waistcoat less. Then it’s upstairs for a nightcap and to watch some television before getting into bed. The sumptuous pillows do the trick and the bed is exceptionally comfortable.You want the Ritz to be perfect. Having been lucky enough to stay in very many grand hotels all over the world, I want the Ritz to be the best. After all, we are here for a treat, and even though we got a deal, it’s not cheap. It’s a shame then that it falls down on several issues. The receptionist on check-in took down our wake-up call as 06.45 AM when we had asked for 7 AM. The following morning it’s not nice to be woken from your sleep before you expect it even if it is with a cup of tea that was offered on check in.  You later find out that this cup of tea has cost you £12. £7 for the tea and a £5 room service charge to bring into the room. That was never mentioned and the room service charge is something I absolutely hate. Given that the Ritz has a ratio of two staff to every one guest room and that the room service prices are not cheap, adding on a room service charge seems to be unacceptable at the very least. There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, so you have no choice but to pay £12 to get a cup of tea.It was midnight by the time we discovered that the heating system in the room made a noise and hardly the time that we wanted maintenance to start trying to do something about it. We turned it off. A mistake. The beautiful sheets on the bed are thin. Two thin sheets and a thin blanket are no protection against the cold of London January night when you’re on the seventh floor. The cold kept waking me and I’m afraid the Ritz gave me one of the worst night’s sleep I’ve had for a while. We put our shoes outside the bedroom door to be polished - a real old-fashioned hotel treat. the following morning I looked outside and the shoes had not been polished. I rang down to the concierge and this was remedied. When they came back a second time they’d certainly been polished, but they lacked the gleaming shine that I had been expecting. Perhaps that just sort of sums up the hotel. After a conversation with a charming manager they were kind enough to refund half the room rate, and  offered us an upgrade on our return but I was just disappointed. I was quite happy to have paid through the nose for my night at the Ritz. It was a treat for me and my partner, and it hadn’t been quite the treat we’d anticipated. A bit like getting close up to your Hollywood idol, and seeing that on closer inspection, there are blemishes.  I don’t think I’ll be taking them up on the upgrade offer.", January 2017, Travelled as a couple

The concierge were more helpful than any hotel I have ever stayed at. I felt like they were family by the end of our trip.(we were there for a week). They greeted us by name and their recommendations were spot on.  Due to the great location you could walk anywhere. Shopping, museums and a majority of the sites. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for luxurious accomadations without the attitude    Thank you to the hotel management and staff for the delightful stay.

rondoidge,19,29,A huge disappointment!,[1.0],The room was several hours late for occupation.No upgrade and just left to wait in the foyer.No drinks or afternoon tea offered.We were told our party would get a discount but later they backtracked to a discount on one room for one night only.Our complaint got us a first night discount for all of our party.When the room was ready we were asked about our departure.Charming.A poor table for dinner .When we asked to move the front desk girl pulled a face.Dear oh dear!I thought the Ritz was top class!, December 2016,nan
Liverpool_reviewer,17,12,Birthday treat - amazing service,[5.0],"My partner and I visited the Ritz just prior to Christmas to celebrate a milestone birthday and were given an upgrade on arrival plus birthday cake and card in the room. Very nice touches.   The service from absolutely everyone was fantastic - the more so as my partner required unexpected urgent medical attention in the early hours of the morning and staff could not have done more to help. In what was a stressful and difficult period they helped in so many ways and this really sums up why this hotel has such a well deserved reputation.   If you need somewhere special to stay in London at any time, but especially at Christmas when the hotel looks amazing, do seriously consider the Ritz. I'll certainly be back. Top class.", December 2016,nan

We arrived very early in the morning knowing we couldn't check in until 14:00 but they offered to keep our bags for us while we moved around London. Then we arrived to check in and were escorted to our room and given an adapter for a charger (my girlfriend being American was very relieved) and told we had dressing gowns in the bathroom along with slippers, branded by the Ritz, that we could keep! We had a lovely chat with our host Nancy about the history of the hotel.

We had had our first child a few months ago so it was supposed to be a special experience for us. The hotel met my expectations in decor, it really is a stunning place, however the customer service disappointed me a lot. On checking in we were told that a deposit of £150 was required, I was unaware of this and I can't find any information on this anywhere, however did expect to give my card details to cover if something was broken or if we used the mini bar.

We have stayed at the Ritz a couple of times and been for dinner/drinks on numerous other occasions. However the overall impression of the hotel is that the staff feel they are doing you a favour by letting you stay.  This time it was our honeymoon and despite being a Leading Hotels member no upgrade is offered (despite hotel being empty). Package included fruit in the room, but it took THREE requests to get this from staff.  The doormen knew it was our honeymoon as soon as we said our name, but no other staff ever acknowledged it.

Breathtaking Christmas decorations, atmosphere, the beauty of a piano and carols for the tea.

The bathroom was well designed and featured with heated towel racks... always a nice touch.  The public spaces were all beautifully decorated, and as we were there during the festive time, a large center piece Christmas tree took over the reception area.

We had tasty sandwiches cakes hot scones cream and jam then we had mince pies and Christmas cake  washed down with xmas tea and champagne! There were carol singers entertaining us alongside a piano which was really festive. My only negative point was we had a lot of leftover cakes! When we asked if we could box them up no was the answer. I felt this was unfair after paying £79 each for the tea! , December 2016,nan
john b,21,16,The Rivoli bar,[4.0],Having visited the ritz for lunch for 3 years running I feel I must make a point.

Fancy interiors with staircases for overly dressed clientele to have their photos snapped, tea service on proper China, and a rigid dress code rule the day.  The dining room even requires ""proper"" footware.  In lieu of my unacceptable $250 sneakers, staff loaned me a pair of Versace loafers so that I may be served dinner.  Rooms are of average size for London, room service is hit or miss.  The location is good -- close to a popular tube station and the best of upscale shopping.

Unlimited tea and sandwiches and cakes and scones. Nothing was too much for the waiters.

Having said that we were offered a room upgrade which we initially thought was not necessary so they upgraded us to a suite anyway.  Suite?  More like a small palace.  Very attentive staff in fact so attentive that when I left for a business meeting as I passed each member of staff who would open the door for me they knew my name.  Nice touch.

I would highly recommend it to go to the restaurant, the breakfast is unbelievable. If you want some luxury that is the place for you.  As for rooms, well I stayed only in one room, it was quite outdated, I was a bit disappointed, in general rather nice and clean, rather oldish bathroom too. It faced Piccadilly, but it was rather quiet so I could sleep. Good size I must say and comfy bed.  So it is really up to you. But definitely go for tea or a meal in the restaurant!", April 2016,nan

Suaveguy5,4,11,30th Birthday ,[5.0],"A truly luxurious hotel. I stayed here for my thirtieth birthday a couple of years ago. With its opulent architecture, and sparkling chandeliers, you have a feeling your staying at a Royals residence. On entering our suite we were met by fine classical music. Along with a lovely little birthday cake and Card. The staff are what really make the hotel, nothing is too much trouble. I thought I may have missed breakfast as I'd slept in and arrived five to ten minutes late. But the waiter assured me I would be accommodated for, and proceeded to serve me a superb breakfast. As I sat alone staring at the marble columns, draping curtains, neoclassical statues, and Renaissance painted ceiling, I felt like a prince for a moment.

pontelandvoyager,23,20,excellent stay,[5.0],I stayed in the Ritz Hotel last week with my mother who is in her 80s. We had a fabulous stay and nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff to make our stay more enjoyable. One of the Rivoli staff made my mothers night by linking with her to take her to her seat and having a little with her dance too! Our room was lovely overlooking Green Park and though I have read some comments saying the rooms are dated I think it is worth noting that this is a classic hotel - not a high tech modern hotel with no character. Well worth the money and such a convenient location. We used the tube a couple of times rather than taxi as the hotel is so conveniently placed for the underground at Green Park - you miss the traffic that way.. Can't thank the team enough for their kind attention., November 2016,nan

This featured a long hall with a large fitted cupboard and a chest of drawers, with a small dressing room and en-suite bathroom off to the side.  The main room had even more storage (enough to happily stay here for weeks) and was beautifully decorated and furnished.

When we first arrived, when we checked in, when we were shown around the hotel and our room, and when we checked out, I had to speak to new person.

Certainly from the point of interior and decor it has proved to be a far gentler, and more controlled emulation of the opulent grandeur which characterised the Chateau of Versailles that Marie Antoinette has become historically famous for; considering what we are told, that the Hotel's founder, Cesar Ritz, sought inspiration from the Chateau of Versailles, one does appreciate and marvel at the much calmer elegance that he has been able to capture as the hotel's general atmosphere which is so very relaxing.

Hotels need to learn that women travel for business and have needs, most people, at the Ritz will be over 40 so a shaving make up mirror with decent lighting should not be a luxury but should be the basic equipment.

I wanted to make this such a special time for my wife who had no idea until the taxi pulled up outside the Ritz as to what was happening and then she was in tears.We checked in and the staff said they were more than happy to give us an upgraded room although it wasn't ready at that point and if we would mind waiting, absolutely not we said and we're more than happy to wait.We decided to shop for awhile and on our return the room wasn't quite ready, the staff apologised, we still didn't mind but they offered us a complimentary drink of champagne in the bar, the bar staff were so helpful we knew this was the start of something very special.Once the room was ready we were collected by a member of staff and taken to our room, she was very informative as we were taken to our room.Our room door was opened we stepped inside and our breath was taken away, what an amazing room, the member of staff gave us a very detailed explanation of the facilities in the room.She then pointed out that the hotel had taken the time to give my wife a birthday cake and some chocolates with a card, again so special.We were booked in for dinner and arrived just before 8pm we were greeted and led to our table, we just stood for a moment in awe of our surrounds, what a beautiful room.There was no rush plenty of time between courses to enjoy the evening,the waiters and staff were very professional and the food was superb.When we had finished the meal we wandered down to the casino, we didn't gamble on this occasion but the casino really is something to see, I've never seen a casino looking so grand.We then retired for the evening to our beautiful room.Breakfast the next day was very nice and the service again was excellent.The time came to check out and again the staff were brilliant asking about our stay and if we were happy with everything and general conversation.In summary.We've just encountered our best hotel experience ever in staying at the Ritz.From walking through the doors on arrival to walking out the same doors on leaving, we were made to feel so special and created memories that we can never forget.All of the staff we encountered couldn't do enough for us and they are a credit to the Ritz.Thank you so muchMr & Mrs Shaw", October 2016, Travelled as a couple

Our room on this occasion was a superior King and though obviously not as large as the junior suite we were upgraded to on our previous visit, it was just as immaculately presented, with large ceiling to floor Windows, a beautiful ornamental fireplace and a very comfortable king-size bed. The beautiful furniture complimented the style of the room perfectly and added to the traditionally luxurious feel. As it was our anniversary the staff had arranged a few little extra treat for us. This was a wonderful unexpected surprise and definitely made us feel very special. Once we were settled and unpacked we went to the bar for a couple of cocktails. Pricey but worth it, pretty and delicious, and once again in a beautiful setting. We had booked a table for the dinner dance that evening which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Make sure to book a table in the bar in advance or you will end up in the common areas just outside the bar, not a problem but not the same. The main restaurant has apparently obtained one star recently but it was just good not exceptional and we have certainly had better many times in similar restaurants within this price bracket. One thing to be aware of was that there is a constant stream of afternoon tea guests celebrating one thing of another.

My wife expressed her fondness for shortbread cookies we received at tea on arrival when we were leaving the hotel for awhile, only to find a box on our coffee table when we returned.

The reason behind the ""suite"" description was the fact that the two doors were behind one door. Not impressed as both rooms were charged at the same price. We felt that one couple had the ""parents room"" and the other couple were in the ""children's quarters"", very small room, no bath only shower, cramped and extremely noisy from street noise, at £550 per room per night, not at all impressed with the ""suite"" tale. Breakfast was somewhat intermittent with service,  lacking the professionalism which we had found outstanding on a previous visit many years earlier. Eggs were ordered as scrambled, delivered as fried. Following morning asked for omelette and abruptly asked how we wanted it cooking and when we asked what fillings, we were told, try to ask for something and I'll tell you if we have it!!

However, comparing with other venues eg. The Savoy and The Dorchester we felt it fell short. The sandwiches were lovely,  the scones lovely but the cakes were disappointing and usually where you get one of each per person this was not the case. They did come around with a trolley and serve a slice of dessert which was nice.

The afternoon tea is pricey at around £52 per head without champagne. However the scones are the best that I have ever tasted and I was well catered for as a vegetarian with a lovely selection of sandwiches made from a variety of different breads.The ladies rest room is well worth a visit as it has wonderful trompe  l'oeil walls as you descend the staircase, and a full range of newspapers, magazines and iced water, should you wish to relax for a while. The tea is served by very well trained staff whom if you leave your phone or camera on the table will discretely pick it up and take a photo of your party. There is a dress code so do check this out before visiting. You will be reminded if you book online anyway. You have two hours from your booking time so do not feel rushed at all.

The hotel used to have a strict dress code, tie and blazer. I was sad to see that now you can walk in the hall are without tie and that the dress code is only related the tea room. I loved the formality and the English tradition but I understand That lot of clients complained. For the new clients that are planing to go here: 1- it's not a Ritz Carlton... Nothing to do with that. 2- it's not a fashion hotel like the Ritz in Paris. It's all about elegance and tradition3- no spa 4- enjoy the real elegance English style.

I had requested a halal option at the time of booking so we were presented with a halal selection of sandwiches and cakes/pastries, huge teapots of tea and warm scones followed by a cake trolley. Everything was replenished frequently as soon as we had finished, as many times as you wish and you can try as many different teas as you wish.

Andrea H,3,3,Disappointed,[3.0],"I was sorely disappointed in this hotel. On the first night we found a piece of green glass in my sisters pasta that was about the length of a quarter. The staff was apologetic and we weren't terribly upset about it at first, but unfortunately things didn't get much better from there. Another evening we were disrupted by constant phone calls to the bathroom phone. The staff was trying to reach another room and I told them they had the wrong room each time I answered. After the third call the man on the other line would simply hang up at the sound of my voice, yet they called about three more times after that. Finally the manager called once more to apologize for the disturbance but it was frustrating considering this was all happening at around 10 pm after a very long day.The room itself was small, and certain details made the room seem and feel cheap. The drain in the sink didn't work (it would fill with water the moment the faucet turned on), the wood around the bathtub was peeling in rather large sections from water damage, and we had to buy a power strip because several different styles of our travel adapters continued to fall out of the outlets (of which there were few).Finally, I left a dress and a shirt in one of the drawers, which was admittedly my fault. However, after paying as much as we did for the room and dealing with all of this nonsense, I found it a bit ridiculous that we did not receive a phone call to let us know that they had found my clothing items. When I called to ask if they had seen them, the staff knew exactly where they were and they had just neglected to inform me. Fortunately we had not returned home to the states at this point and I was able to have them ship it to our hotel in Paris. Nevertheless, I expected more from the Ritz.", August 2016, Travelled with family

Simon G,17,0,Fantastic Stay,[5.0],"I booked for the deluxe suite for 3 nights,  but eventually only stayed for 2 because of schedule changes, but already I have to say that it is one of the best hotels I've stayed at.The rooms themselves are quite olde worlde and full of class. Almost all furnitures are finely restored antiques, including a mirrored oak hall tree coat rack, a rococo dressing table, a telephone style handheld shower head and etc. Every corner of the room is decorated with golden leaves and paints, even the air conditioning unit is no exception.  It almost feels like a time travel back to the 60s. The room services are quite impeccable as well. The servers certainty have received proper training in etiquette and are quite knowledgeable in wines. The concierge is welcoming and very willing to help. The most interesting part of all is the turndown service -- beside the bed is a door that seems to be decorative, but as the maids turn down the linen, they open the door and there is actually a hidden cellar behind it for storing those bedspreads and cushions!  Have to love these little bits of details here and there.That said, there are 2 concerns that I'd like to address. One being the checking in process, which is painfully slow -- I phoned the hotel up in the morning, they promised to ready the suite before 2pm. As I arrive at the hotel at 2:40, the receptionist told me that they are doing a few final touches to the suite, and offered me some tea at the ravioli bar after promising to inform me when it's ready.  So I waited at the bar for another 40 minutes only to find out that the suite was ready and she forgot to tell me.Another issue is the shower door, which makes a squeaking noise as I tried to close it, probably because the rubber is too tight (not something I would expect from a suite of this level) . I phoned house keeping up, they sent someone to fix it but there didn't seem to be much he can do about it.Of course,  those are only very minor flaws,  and the manager did later on sent me a letter and a bottle of wine with some chocolates as apologies,  so I'm still very pleased with the overall experience.", August 2016, Travelled solo

supauk,11,17,A Let down and its a shame!,[3.0],"We recently stayed at The Ritz, London,on May 16th. We have regularly stayed with them and have done for approx. 12 years normally two to three times per year minimum. Over the last few visits we have been let down by the decline in service. I tried to book via telephone and was transferred 8 times before I found someone who could take my booking. When I eventually spoke to a lady I made it quite clear that it was our wedding anniversary and therefore we wanted to be located in a quiet place preferably overlooking the park. When we arrived for our stay, we again made it clear at the front desk that it was our anniversary and we had no intention of going anywhere we just wanted to relax. We were taken to our room and to our dismay we were overlooking the rear buildings of The Ritz, not a good view at all! I advised the lady who was with us of our request, however she said unfortunately it wasn't a guarantee but she would mention it. She offered us tea which we accepted and she advised it would be sent to the room immediately. After 45 minutes the tea had not arrived so we called room service and asked where it was. They apologised and advised it would be sent immediately. The tea arrived 10 minutes later. There was loud banging and drilling noises coming from the hallway next to our room, we asked the room service gentleman and he advised they were making repairs to the electrics and were working in the ceiling area next to our room. Due to the noise we decided to go shopping and left for Harrods. The next morning the noise resumed at around 8.45am even though I had requested peace and quiet we had been placed in a room which was next to where they were working on repairs. The noise continued continually. We had to ring 3 times for someone to collect our bags. We paid our bill at reception and mentioned the room, noise and lack of service. The lady who had shown us to our room advised she would refer everything to the manager and he would be in touch. Today is the 20.7.2016 and no one has made any contact with us. We feel it is a shame but over the last couple of years we feel the Ritz has gone from being a hotel which went the extra mile to make their guests stay special, to their guests becoming just a number who go in and out of a revolving door. Loyalty to the Ritz has had no benefit in the service we now receive. We have become a number that pops up the same as a number in a bingo hall, sometimes you are lucky and everything seems to go ok but in the main you are missed and forgotten.", May 2016, Travelled as a couple

Jeffrey C,25,9,Wonderful stay!,[5.0],"I was a bit hesitant to stay at The Ritz a few months back. I know it's a property which has been around for quite some time and is considered to be one of the best in London, but I wondered if it's best years had passed by. Luckily my hypothesis was unfounded. We pulled into The Ritz early Thursday morning after a red eye flight from DC and the gentlemen at the door were eager to assist us with getting out of the car and grabbing our luggage. The receptionist were just as kind and eager to check us in and escort us up to our junior suite. Service during our entire stay could not have been better and my wife and I truly appreciated it.The room itself was decently sized for a junior suite. The room was well appointed in traditional British luxury. I will note that the floors squeaked a bit and the shower was rather small. However, you expect this with a property over 100 years old. If you stay on the property, you should definitely take advantage of all the hotel has to offer. This includes tea at the infamous tea room. This is a special treat with all of the waiters wearing tails (the waiters even wear tails during breakfast!). While you ""only"" have 90 minutes for tea, it is plenty of enough time and you never feel rushed. It's a really neat experience. The Trivoli Bar is a bit more toned down than tea and a great place to grab a drink or a bite to eat in the afternoon/evening. Dinner service on the weekends is fancy, as well. It includes dancing and music and is another neat experience.All-in-all the hotel is wonderful and service even better. One of my favorite aspects is that they still offer you a key to the room rather than a key card. It's just a small touch but reminds you that they are keeping with their traditional roots. Lastly, the location of the property is excellent. You can easily walk to St. James Palace, Buckingham Palace, Bond St., Piccadilly Circus, etc. My advice, if you can stay at The Ritz, do it.

Michael W,33,18,There's just no place like it...putting on the Ritz!,[5.0],"I have dined at The Ritz three times in my life...once in the 60s with my parents, once in 2010 with daughter Kristen, and this week while on holiday in London with my darling Elizabeth; and on each occasion I came away with truly superlative memories of the food and service.We arrived for dinner a touch early because we wanted to experience having a drink at the Rivoli Bar.  Bottom Line: the booze tasted the same, the surroundings were luxurious but not impressive (perhaps I'm too old to be really impressed by a bar), although the service was extremely professional and friendly. Good but expensive for what you got.Then, down the hall from the lobby to the end where the two story baronial main dining room is located, repeat with windows facing Green Park and tables spaced appropriately so you don't overhear your neighbours' conversations. The 2.5 hours at dinner seemed to fly by watching waiters with black tie and tails maneuvering about the room in a well rehearsed choreography of movements that was entertaining in and of itself.The crab and foie gras appetizers from the menu came perfectly prepared and served...and the white Burgundian wine I had chosen was fabulous (the Sommelier actually complemented me on the choice...everyone gets lucky once in a while). When ordering the main course, we asked about a regular menu item which wasn't listed that night...no argument/no problem / ""delighted sir to accommodate""...and when the veal tenderloin with fresh morels arrived it just about knocked my socks off.The crushed watermelon and mint palate cleanser was both novel and delicious, paving the way for Crepes Suzette flambé  prepared table-side...A+ for that one too.Yes the food was pretty close to perfect in all respects, but the care taken by the staff, at every level, to present a friendly yet highly professional dining experience was extraordinary. We hope to return for more of The Ritz soon.Food was expensive, but all in we felt good about the value received...full course dinner (including tip) for two was £ 175 plus wine.", July 2016, Travelled as a couple

Nellybucket,192,92,First class all the way.,[5.0],"My husband surprised me with a day out in London and our first experience of visiting this amazing establishment.  As a wheelchair user, one has to enter through an entrance concealed behind gates but from the moment the top hat, liveried gentleman guided us through to the moment we departed a few hours later, we had an incredible time with 1st class service throughout.  Each staff member treated us with utmost courtesy and informed knowledge of the menu whether food or drink.  I think I can truly say, this was THE best time/experience I have ever had in any hotel in the UK and in any hotel I have traveled to in the world.  It is so opulent with beautiful and varied decor and I adore the Lalique I espied in the Rivoli Bar where we had lunch.  The barman in there mixed an amazing Rivoili 75 cocktail for my husband and the flair and flamboyance he displayed whilst creating it and shaking it was worth the (almost) 2 hours train journey alone!

The whole ambience is wonderful, the gilt chairs, crystal chandeliers, soft carpets - perfect.  The staff are excellent, courteous and friendly, eager to ensure a good experience.  There is a central buffet table laden with goodies, from cheeses, smoked salmon, ham, fresh fruit in abundance, house made yoghurt to pastries, little bread rolls, croissants ......etc etc.  We had a cooked English breakfast (as well!) beautifully cooked and plated, as much toast and coffee as we required. Our waiter was very helpful - and though I think we were the last patrons to leave, there wasn't even a hint of impatience.  It isn't cheap obviously, but you are not just paying for breakfast but an all round experience which i think is well worth the money.

And goes back as far as 1906 by the time it was finished. This precious gemstone is a Grade II listed 5-star hotel located in Piccadilly in London, England. A symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel is one of the world's most prestigious and best known hotels. It is a member of the international consortium, The Leading Hotels of the World. The building is Neoclassical in the Louis XVI manner, built during the Belle Époque to resemble a stylish Parisian block of flats, over arcades that consciously evoked the Rue de Rivoli. It really shows not only in its majestic construction, furniture, details and great cuisine, but the service is like going back in time. Dedicated attention to the Detail, Tailored Service and a nostalgic air of those things that vanished almost completely through time all over the world, but are still kept in this wonderful landmark of London.

We drove to the hotel and the doorman met us at the kerbside.  We were greeted warmly and he welcomed us back.  Arrangements were made for parking the car and for our luggage to be brought it, while another doorman escorted us into the building and to reception.  The receptionist already knew who we were and greeted us by name, again welcoming us warmly to The Ritz.  After completing check-in we were shown to our room, having been given a guided tour of the hotel.  Our luggage arrived soon after we did.  The room was at the front of the hotel overlooking Piccadilly and it was beautifully decorated with accents of gold on white.  There was a seating area and the bed was big and very comfortable.  The bathroom had all the amenities you could want, including a lovely large bath.  There were the usual complimentary toiletries, plus lovely slippers and bathrobes.  Everything was very clean and tidy.  As it was an anniversary celebration, the evening ""turn-down"" service left rose petals on our bed in the shape of a heart, with a rose in the middle and a rose on each pillow, plus rose petals at the side of the bed by the slippers, which was a lovely touch.  On the evening of our anniversary we ate in the restaurant and the service from the waiting staff was exceptional - they work superbly as a team and nothing is too much trouble for them.  It was a pleasure to be served by them and to watch them work.  In fact, all the staff that we came into contact with from the doormen, reception staff, concierge, waiting staff in Palm Court and the Rivioli bar and the waiters in the restaurant, every single member of staff did everything they could, with a smile and friendly disposition, to make our stay wonderful and memorable.  I cannot thank the staff enough for how pleasant they all were.

Sarah S,25,16,Somewhat an Afternoon Tea Factory,[3.0],"My husband and I stayed there a few weeks ago for a romantic weekend.Firstly the positives - great location for shopping, particularly for men, great Asprey toiletries in the bathroom which was an excellent size, beautiful breakfast room with an excellent breakfastHowever I would not stay again as the negatives outweigh the positives. The foyer is busy the entire time as they have five Afternoon tea sittings per day. Yes five. My husband refused to believe it and I had to take him to speak to someone to confirm this. It starts at something like 11am and finishes at 19.30 pm which means it is frantic. There were even people at the breakfast who had not stayed over. This means you need to constantly push your way through the foyer and if you are well dressed are somewhat gaped at The bar is full full full and even though we were there at 19.15 it was impossible to sit down or get a drink. I realise I am being horrendous but I have a distinct feeling that the numerous female patrons there, all identically dressed were um, on the look out. My husband then remembered that he had been there a few times with his city friends when they were drunk to pick people up before he remembered who he was speaking to, whereupon he quickly said we should go somewhere else..... Whilst the bedroom was niceish I did expect it to be much better and there were no fresh flowers except for a lone rose in the bathroom. There were no flowers in the hallways and it had a lost sort of atmosphere. They did make an attempt with a rose petal heart on the bed when we returned after dinner but it was such a made for instagram moment that it felt tacky. I would have prefered the roses beside my bed in a small vase.I am glad to have ticked it off my list but I do not intend to return. To be frank they do need to refurbish it. And at the end the porters helping us into the taxi were not at all interested in helping us and more interested in chatting up casual visitors. Chatting up being the expression here.

It was our Wedding Anniversary the day we visited and just when I thought the meal had finished we were presented with a small but beautiful complimentary Wedding Anniversary cake with lighted candles atop- which was just the perfect end to a perfect experience. We were just too full to eat it so were given an ultra smart doggy bag to take home- along with another ultra smart doggy bag for my bread roll!

John M,40,7,Excellent 70th Birthday at the Ritz,[5.0],"I completely forgot to put this review in after our three day stay there to celebrate my wife’s 70th birthday in early May: I had great fun booking this without her finding out where she was going and managed to spring the surprise on her as we drove past the hotel to check in.  I booked the ‘Simply Sunday’ and ‘Putting On The Ritz’ packages (the latter includes the essential ‘Afternoon Tea), which seemed an ideal combination.A truly excellent hotel: Service was exceptional throughout our stay and the staff couldn’t have done more to make our stay any better than it was for this rather special birthday.  We were given a complimentary upgrade and even found a little birthday cake waiting for us in our room and were given a complimentary glass of Champagne on the third night.  Both packages included a bottle of Champagne, but we thought it wise to have the second one with the Afternoon Tea, which was excellent and well worth visiting for that alone.The beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet (much quieter than I expected in central London!).   All in all, a very memorable experience, which we hope to repeat soon.", May 2016, Travelled as a couple

We were then shown to our table and our napkins put on our laps for us before we chose a type of tea which was briskly brought out to us and topped up regularly! The tiered cake stand then came out with a variety of sandwiches and small cakes and the bottom rack was replenished with more sandwiches! The scones were then brought out, two plain and two fruit and an enormous pot of clotted cream and jam! THEN a trolley was brought round offering more cake!

We arrived early before the restaurant opened so had time to look around this iconic building.   The atrium was very busy at 12.30 pm serving afternoon teas for which it is famous.  There did not seem to be an empty table. The restaurant is decorated in a French style with doors opening out on to a balcony and the open doors were a blessing on a hot day.  Service was impeccable and the food beautifully presented.  I finished with cheese and biscuits and was very impressed with the waiter's knowledge of the cheeses on offer.Lunch at The Ritz is more than a meal but is an event.  As a child I often visited London with my parents and passed the hotel which was always considered to be only for other people.

Although I feel so obviously American and too casual when I am there, I love the attentiveness and great service by the staff.  I have not found better service anywhere in the world.

My only negative points were that no one really knows what to do beforehand....as you can only go into the Palm Court area when it is your allotted time, with everyone else at the same time........But once we found out, we sat on one of the many sofa seats around to wait, then queue up.And secondly, should you wish to take one of your delicious pastries or scones home, they do not allow it.

Wonderful service from the head doorman and our car was parked without any fuss. It was £20 and we left the car for over three hours so as well as enjoying the afternoon tea, we had time to visit some neighbouring shops on Bond Street.We used the beautifully decorated powder room, left the pushchair with concierge and then were welcomed, some twenty minutes early for our tea. This was no problem for the staff and each and every one of them were so helpful and friendly.The tea was exquisite and my niece was even given a Ritz bear during our tea, which we are so appreciative of.The hotel lobby is wonderfully and certainly the Ritz is an experience.I wouldn't hesitate to return.", June 2016, Travelled with family

However, it was a hot sunny day in the atrium and whilst all the ladies looked resplendent in their summer dresses all the men had to wear jacket and ties. I was sweating with all of the hot tea. I took my jacket off for 10 seconds and was asked to put it back on. Ridiculous sexism!! I agree that a dress code is essential, but with no aircon, next time I will wear a summer dress to see how I get on.

FDeuchars,26,15,Most amazing afternoon tea ever ,[5.0],"We booked afternoon tea month's in advance for my sister's birthday and had a girls day. From the moment we arrived we were fussed over from all staff, especially Giovanni. There is a huge selection of teas to choose from but I had The Ritz's unique English tea which was tasty. A big selection of sandwiches and cakes were brought out first, which were quickly replenished. The second course was warm, moist scones with clotted cream and jam, finally followed by a trolley of two different cakes with chocolate hazelnut or ginger and rhubarb. You can have orange juice if you don't drink tea. The food was absolutely divine and of the highest quality possible. The dining area has remained classical and elegant and something special from the early 1900's. There was a harp playing adding to the classical era. We paid an extra £12 for a birthday cake to be brought out, the whole room clapped and joined in singing to my sister. Yes it's a bit pricey but the overall experience and the amount of food you get, it's definitely worth it. I'm a breastfeeding mother but left my baby at home and they arranged a quiet room for me to express in, nothing was too much trouble. I would definitely visit again and again.

Ive seen people giving bad reviews over being rejected because they were inappropriately dressed.. Think about it, it's not the sort of place you wear trainers and it clearly states on their website that you must adhere to their dress code so it's not really fair to give a bad review on those grounds.

It was classy with pleasant fellow diners and very attentive staff who were unobtrusive. My wife and I were able to talk happily without overhearing the conversations from the next door tables and ,of course the food was excellent and plentiful- far too much even. It is expensive but actually one of those exoeriences that is worth it although only once every 5 years or so. It is difficult to book as clearly very popular and the room was full when we visited.

The rooms the rest of us had were okay, old fashioned, in need of refurbishment, shower over the bath which I don't expect from this grade of hotel.  The dinner on the evening was good with generally good service.  We went to the bar in the hotel for after dinner drinks and was told quite forcefully by the waiter when we asked to order a bottle of Champagne, wine and cocktails that we  were only allowed one drink each and the bar would be closing in half an hour.  The waiters assumed we were not residents and when we complained, reflected on their manner and served us accordingly.  It is always better never to assume and treat guests with respect!!

AnnIrons60,15,11,Afternoon tea (at 7.30pm!),[5.0],"This was booked about four months ago (first available booking) and it was worth the wait!

An extensive choice of teas, including a very tasty decaf (and filter coffee if you are not a tea drinker). Surroundings are just beautiful and a pianist with an extensive repertoire. The only thing that spoiled this was right at the beginning; we went to where we thought the entrance was and was immediately blocked by a gentleman who wanted to know our business...just a very slight feeling of menace? Or 'you're not good enough for this entrance'?However, this was quickly made up for by a delightful, older, very polite and helpful gentleman in uniform on the correct door.....

The hotel itself is luxuriously appointed, being luxurious and plush, whilst at the same time maintaining an elegant simplicity. The staff in the restaurant and the Rivoli bar were equally attentive and friendly - there when they were needed, but away often enough for you to feel relaxed. Once the door staff realise that you're a guest, you're treated as though you are an old friend whose come home.

The gentlemen at the front desk had each worked in the position for about 30 years. They knew what you needed before you asked.

John L,205,62,"Superb dinner, in style",[5.0],"We wanted to celebrate a special occasion and where better to do it it style other than eating at The Ritz. We were not disappointed. In fact we had an evening to remember.Firstly, we were lucky enough to have found a special offer on 'Book a Table', making this usually expensive, but delightfully opulent restaurant, affordable. The deal made us no less equally received than any other diners. The very courteous check in at reception, leading us to our reserved table was most polite and well mannered by the excellent staff, to the main dining room - past the palm court, afternoon tea area.The waiters introduce themselves in a most charming manner and are very relaxed and friendly. For those somewhat nervous of such a grand venue, don't be, it is very relaxed.Obviously you have to dress appropriately, as befitting the standards of this 110 year old, first class, establishment.Our choice of three options for each of our three course choices from our deal, gave us enough variety to enjoy such a wonderful evening meal. Nothing is hurried and you are treated to the lovely 'tinkling of the ivories' of a pianist quietly playing the most appropriate of tunes, later accompanied by a singer, who again was not overpowering in her choice of delightful songs.Any query of the content of any dish, wines etc., is met with a happy explanation. Your table napkins are folded and neatly placed if you have to leave your table for the cloakrooms (which are as clean and tidy as one would expect). A small cake was even presented with our coffees as I had mentioned that ours was an anniversary visit - a nice touch. In fact every manner and custom is afforded for your visit, so just sit back and enjoy the wonderful food and ambience of one of London's finest restaurants. We did. Excellent.

Louise H,192,62,"A place that everyone should visit and stay at, at least once in their life :)",[5.0],"Beautiful, elegant and wonderful 30th birthday spent at The Ritz with my husband :) Made to feel like a princess from the moment we checked in! Stayed for one night in one of the deluxe suites and had afternoon tea also. Staff can't do enough for you from the minute we stepped out of the car, to check in, afternoon tea and room service. Really was a wonderful and overwhelming experience. We had a private tour of the hotel including a sneak peek at the club casino and other areas of the hotel. Afternoon tea was delicious and highly recommend to people who enjoy the more traditional afternoon teas :) Only snag of our trip was a payment error; there was an incident when checking in where the money for the deposit was taken twice then my bill taken all over again a couple of days after we were home. It did cause a little bit of friction to say the least but eventually, this was rectified and handled accordingly with compensation offered as best as they could. Big thank you to Ben on reception for the tour, Julian for looking after our luggage, William Sloan for helping with the payment issue and Dhaval the assistant manager for helping with it also. Compliments to the afternoon tea staff, door man, porters, room service and club staff also for being so attentive and professional also. Overall, I think everyone should experience a night at the Ritz at least once in their life as it truly was a special and wonderful experience. Will hopefully be back again one day :)", February 2016, Travelled as a couple

As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the doorman Michael who made us feel really welcome before we had even stepped inside the hotel. Michael took us to reception where once again the staff were friendly and welcoming. We were then shown around the hotel which was a nice touch and taken up to our room where our luggage was already waiting for us. The room was amply big enough and the decor was lovely and even the towels, bedding, dressing gown and slippers were very luxurious. It made you not want to leave the room! We decided to have a drink in The Rivoli Bar and once again the staff were friendly and the bar had a lovely ambience. We both had a cocktail which was amazing and I definitely recommend trying one whilst you are there. All in all we had a fantastic time and are now saving to go back again.", April 2016, Travelled as a couple

We found a rather diffident staff person, who took us and another guest down some back stairs, through a kitchen, to an alternative elevator several floors below, which finally took us to the lobby.

From the time you arrive until the time you leave the staff treat like you are returning Royalty. It's really nice to be made to feel that welcome and special these days especially in a major city.  It's not surprising that armies of people wait months to come here for the afternoon teas.  You also need to have breakfast here if you want a real treat.

Our waiter was very good indeed - he was quite inexperienced and obviously very nervous but that was fine and all added to the experience - he was excellent. As I mentioned the early dinner menu at the Ritz is limited but we easily found something we enjoyed - my only grumble would not be aimed at the restaurant but at the website (Lovetheatre) I booked the package through.

Staff were very attentive, very kind, and very welcoming - we couldn't have asked for more in that department. Breakfast was sumptuous, in a beautiful setting - although I did resent the lax attitude to general attire for this restaurant - several patrons were dressed in jogging bottoms and trainers.......not quite what you'd expect at the Ritz! The incredible quality of the food and service more than made up for this slight blemish however. The rooms, whilst well appointed, didn't quite make us 'click' as much as the ones at the Dorchester I'm afraid to say, but this is very much a question of personal taste as everything was clean, comfortable, and generally very pleasant.

The Ritz is very grand and charming and the first impressions were great. After we put our coats into the cloakroom we were seated at our table. All of the staff were so polite, friendly and attentive, as you would expect from a world-renowned hotel. We were brought the champagne and given a choice of around 13 different teas. The waiter was more than happy to make recommendations on these. We were then brought a selection of sandwiches and cakes, and these were replaced as soon as we finished. We also had both fruit and plain scones with jam and clotted cream. Towards the end of the afternoon tea another waiter went around with a dessert trolley with two more desserts, so make sure you leave some room for these! The waiters will just keep on bringing more food so be prepared to be very full when you leave!There was a pianist playing throughout the experience that really added to the lovely atmosphere.

Neil H,19,20,Classic Hotel but very overpriced for what you get.,[3.0],"This is one of the great hotels and there is no arguing about that however I did not particularly enjoy my stay, it left a slightly bad taste in my mouth. Obviously the staff are very attentive however I found their manner slightly condescending.Unlike most luxury hotels you certainly won't find anything ""complimentary"" in this establishment. The rooms themselves can't be faulted but on arrival (we stayed for 3 nights) one finds a ""small"" bottle of mineral water in a plastic bottle priced £6 and an equally priced tiny bag of peanuts that would come free on any but the most budget of airlines. I wouldn't mind paying £6 for a little snack if there was something warranting that price tag; the seeds of a Peruvian cactus that flowers once every 30 years for example of if the water was the melt water of a 10,000 year old Himalayan glacier but they are not. They are just products I could buy at a kiosk close to the hotel for 60p apiece. Just because you have money to stay at the Ritz doesn't mean you don't recognize when you are getting absurdly bad value for money.These days even a humble coffee shop offers free WiFi. I telephoned reception and asked how I could connect to to the Hotel network and was told someone would come to my room. A couple of minutes later a member of staff arrived with quite a large electronic box and some wires and spent some time on his hands and knees connecting various wires and at length, with his finger on a button and a slightly smug look on his face (might have been my imagination) said ""shall I connect you sir? It will cost you £25"". I felt well and truly setup. Of course no guest at The Ritz is going to say no, take it away. The whole pantomime seemed very well rehearsed. In fact the staff come across a lot of the time as seasoned double glazing salesmen who are always trying to push you to part with your money, it did make me wonder whether the staff at The Ritz were on some sort of commission for get the guests to pay for extras the zeal with which they pushed things forward. We had dinner in the Hotel on Saturday night. Again very expensive and nothing special. A band played through dinner and for dancing afterwards. True to form The Ritz makes you pay for the pleasure by way of a £35 cover charge per table for the music. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with this working band, they were very competent however no different than a host of other restaurant bands playing in other restaurants for no extra cost to the diners. The dining room was large and by my calculation the money raised from the cover charge alone would have been enough to pay for one of London's leading jazz musicians to play through dinner and a separate dance band later.The saying goes ""you get what you pay for""; sadly not at the Ritz, just very overpriced mediocrity.

I mentioned it was my birthday, received complimentary champagne in the bar and when we got to the room a small cake and a hand written postcard was there. Afternoon tea was exquisite and plentiful! Turn down was an experience than more hotels should offer. Breakfast, which we had delivered to the room was tasty, and had more food than you could possibly imagine. The room was spacious, clean and pleasant. Considering we were in central London the noise from outside was minimal. I would recommend this experience should be tried once and I would defintely consider doing this again. Thoroughly enjoyed my birthday stay", January 2016,nan

We were booked into The Wimbourne Room as a private party and got to see the hotel as we were led through, and WOW the room and foyer in the private dining section was just as magnificent.  Super attentive service from the waiters, you also tend to forget they are there until the plates are refilled and you are asked very politely if you would like more tea.

The teas were incredible and champagne is always perfect. The food was just out of this world with a large selection catering to a veggie and someone who wants gluten free.

There is a slight 'conveyor belt' element to it because it's a well oiled machine that runs every day from morning til night but that's the only real negative and it's minor. We loved it.

We were a couple and they sit couples next to each other at round tables which makes for a more enjoyable time. We opted for the optional champagne to start which was delicious.  Huge range of teas to choose from - we had mint infusion and lemon verbena. You start with a small plate of cakes and sandwiches, which are served on a proper afternoon tea stand.

It was Christmas and to walk into the lobby was magical.  The decorations were like a  set from the Nutcracker and it felt special. Drinks were not cheap but we were allowed to taste several before making our choice. However, the highlight of our stay was a bag of peas. We had to cook Christmas lunch for someone and had forgotten to get a bag of frozen peas for a velouté. When the receptionist asked if there was anything she could do for us my husband asked if they had a bag of frozen peas.

jon d,175,299,"As always, virtually perfect",[5.0],"My family spent Christmas at the Ritz, taking four rooms, including a 2 bedroom Deluxe Suite, which unsurprisingly was sublime, and not unlike spending a night in the palace of Versailles.I've stayed at this wonderful hotel many times over the years, and am always astounded that there is never a drop-off in quality or service............it remains the model of hotel bliss, in my opinion.The fact that the Ritz Restaurant doesn't have a Michelin star only goes to show how absurd and politically motivated the Michelin system is. The Ritz Restaurant's food is unquestionably better than, say, Le Gavroche, which quite improbably (to me at least) holds two stars. The Ritz Restaurant is my favourite restaurant on the planet, and sits within my favourite hotel on the planet. What's not to like? :-)Just for the record..........two minor gripes, and neither in any way changes my opinion that this is the world's greatest hotel......1. The room service menu is severely limited. We had many guests in our suite for visits over the holidays, and there are virtually no canape options to be ordered that guests can share. Ok, I guess you could order each a sandwich.......but that's hardly the same thing as a few platters of mixed canapes. And to be honest, the other options are quite few, and really not as extensive or opulent as you'd expect on the room service menu at a hotel of this amazing quality. Ok, end of gripe Number One.2. We had the Christmas lunch (at a whopping £425 a person, I should add). The food was fine, with the first two courses being wonderful dishes that I've had on the normal menu over the years, and the turkey being just OK....but in all fairness there isn't much you can do with Christmas turkey to make it seem exceptional.But what really struck me was that the service was strained, disorganised and very, very slow. Sure, the place was full, but I've eaten in this place many times on weekend nights where it was also full, and the service is always perfect. Moreover,  on Christmas the kitchen don't have to respond extemporally to orders.........as they know in advance what everyone is having, so the service should be MORE efficient on Christmas, not vastly less efficient than normal. We had two small children with us, who only just about survived the 30 minutes plus between courses.There was a close-up magician, who spent about 2 minutes at our table, never to return. Yes, he probably had 40 tables to attend, but at £425 per person, and with kids in attendance, I'd really have thought the hotel would book him for more than just an hour or so, enabling him to make a couple/few visits to each table during the three hours or so of lunch. 'A minor quibble, admittedly.There was a great, very Shakespearean Santa...........but again, his appearance was over almost as soon as it started, and he was probably actually in the room for just about 10 minutes (if that).........and I can tell you that our two kids at least could have done with a lot more of him!But again, overall, our experience over the four days we were in residence was utterly phenomenal as usual.In London, the famous luxury hotels, The Ritz, The Dorchester, Claridges, The Savoy, and arguably The Connaught, are NOT at the same level. The Ritz and Dorchester are very considerably better than the other three in my opinion, and though I love the Dorchester, I must give the nod to The Ritz as London's finest hotel.

The staff is extremely responsive and courteous, remembering our name and arranging for reservations etc.  Dining in the Rivoli Bar was relaxing and delicious in a creative and boldly-designed setting.  Christmas Eve dining in the Palm Court was spectacular.  The Champaign was available in several quality styles, served by Certified Sommelier Mateo.  He also recommended (and we consumed) a wonderful Chateauneuf-du-Pape 2007 with our two entrees, duck and filet of beef tenderloin.  With our dessert, Mateo selected a fine German Riesling from a small vintner near Munich.  High Tea on Christmas day was spectacular and real fun.

The staff are attentive and could not do enough for us. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left all the staff looked after us.

The location is excellent, right by Piccadilly, walking distance from Fortnum and Mason and in close proximity to all the lovely well known exclusive restaurants such as Novikov and Nobu.   The service at breakfast is also excellent; although breakfast is quite highly priced it is worth every penny. You can select the continental for £35 or add a cooked breakfast for around £39.

All of the employees we came across couldn't speak more highly of the hotel and all seemed very happy and none showed any sign of them being unhappy and under stress which was so reassuring it was like a breath of fresh air from the moment we dropped our suitcases off to the moment we left.

The parents' room was lovely but ours was outstanding. The only faults on the room is that, although all top quality, the bathroom is dated.Turn down service was excellent. A good perk is full sky TV but our sound wasn't working for some reason. We never told the hotel this until leaving as we weren't fussed but I'm sure they'd have sorted it.Public areas are amazing. We arrived on the morning after the Christmas trees were erected which added to charm.The Ritz Club is beautiful for a drink.

On entering the Ritz we were confronted by a concierge who told us that we were not dressed to the hotel standard.  We did say that we were looking for our next stay but to no avail.

Maddie4356,5,21,Very disappointing service for a top class hotel,[1.0],"This hotel was part of a rugby World Cup final package. I was very excited and looking forward to staying at the hotel. We had decided to push the boat out for this special weekend which was also our anniversary. On arriving after a long drive we were greeted by a lovely doorman, we checked in and were offered a complimentary drink in the bar, so far so good. Once we had finished our drinks we wanted to go to our room to rest before an evening with rugby greats. We asked for our room key, upon which we were told our room was not yet ready. We had actually checked in 45 minutes earlier and not told there may be an issue. I expressed my displeasure in a quiet manner, stating we had checked in 45 minutes ago and we had had a long journey and did not expect this sort of thing in such an expensive hotel. The excuse was that the hotel was full to capacity and they were having difficulty coping. At least 20 minutes later a room was ready for us. The room was OK but nothing like the photos on line, it was quite small. Next morning we went down to breakfast only to be told that there were no tables, we would have to wait. The least I would have expected was to be shown to an area and offered tea or coffee, no such thing, we just had to hang about in the foyer. When our table was ready we were seated and left to our own devices. We were not told to help ourselves from the cold buffet we just guessed. No one came to take our order for hot drinks it hot breakfast for at least twenty minutes. Once we had ordered we had to wait an age, we can only presume they forgot our order as others were served before us. When our breakfast finally appeared they had to be prompted to remember the drinks, then we had to request teaspoons. On commencing our breakfast we found cold poached eggs and bacon. We have had better service at premier inns. How they can pride themselves on a first class service goodness only knows. On quietly complaining to our rugby rep and also the concern of the doorman apparently the duty manager was informed of the bad service. That night we arrived to a free bottle of champagne, however we would much rather have had good service and did not make up for how all this had spoilt our celebration weekend. We found most of the staff too busy to bother about us, maybe they knew we were on a rugby package and probably may not use the hotel again so they didn't really care about us. We paid an arm and a leg for a luxury weekend, we certainly did not get that. I would say save your money stay at a lesser hotel and get better service and be treated like your custom cares. I wish we had opted for a silver package and not a platinum package. I would not ever go back to this hotel, we were so disappointed. The only bright stars were all the doormen, so friendly and helpful. I gave the one star for the doormen.", November 2015, Travelled as a couple

We had been given a room upgrade which was kind. The room was spacious with a sofa and two desks. Decor is very traditional. Here and there a few scuffs, dents and  blemishes give the room a lived in feel. The bathroom was a bit long and narrow and rather too old fashioned. A shower over the bath is not ideal. The shower sceen swivels across the toilet. Lighting in the room was excellent. Sound proofing also very good. Room service was very good. Prices reflect the prime location and amazing service, however £110 for the house Champagne is still eye watering unless you happen to be an oligarch. Bring your own and ring for some ice. Actually there is already ice in the room, just one example of the breathtaking attention to detail. Everything is monogramed with the Ritz 'R'.  We did not dine in the restaurant other than at breakfast. Breakfast was excellent, even at around £40 each. The buffet is very refined, with superb cheeses and really good thick slices of smoked salmon. The cooked breakfast was perfect. All the staff we met were excellent.

My wife and I recently visited London and again stayed at The Ritz.  I know we would not like to stay anywhere else!In 2012 I wrote about Michael the doorman and Michael the concierge.  It was wonderful to see them both still there and looking very well indeed.  The welcoming greeting on the door by Michael remains a highlight for our visit.  He makes everyone feel special and is a treasure.  Michael the concierge remains efficient as ever.Our room (#301) was just perfect.  The recently renovated bathroom is beautiful and the walk-in shower is wonderful.  Everything is maintained perfectly.  Although the architecture of the building and the decoration of the public areas is truly outstanding, the #1 thing about The Ritz is its staff.  They make you feel like they are very happy that you are there and want to make sure you return.  That works for us.", October 2015, Travelled as a couple

The room could be better and bigger, at that price.  The staff really good and professional.  Although they knew that it was my birthday from the beginning (they saw my passport) and promised a surprise, nothing.  The third night we had a champagne nicely chilled but the sea selection I've ordered was not good at all. Mediocre at best.  Overall the ritz is like a museum, lavish and posh, without great location but doesn't deserve my 5 stars. ", October 2015,nan

We were given a 'Dining at the Ritz' opportunity by our family as a Christmas Gift and as I say it was a wonderful experience, but unfortunately I can only give them a 'Very Good' rating as there were two or three instances where I feel the Ritz failed that night. Firstly we arrived at 7.30 for an 8.00 table, once seated in the lounge area it took 3 attempts over 10/15 minutes to get someone to take a drinks order,  In the Restaurant for some reason cutlery was not laid for our second course, to be fair the staff were mortified when they realised the error and it was resolved…", October 2015,nan

Now I know that a genuinely warm welcome awaits all who pass through its doors, from doormen, porters and reception staff alike. Louis and Michael even greet us by name, which is amazing as we have only stayed infrequently for separate nights over the past few years. The gilded interiors are not glitzy but gracious and add to the warmth of the ambiance. The rooms are very comfortable and well-appointed, with an appropriate level of modern technology. The food is consistently of a high standard, beautifully presented, and in a superb setting with gilded features and an ornately painted ceiling.

I was most impressed with the very low key but very present hotel security.  Look-e-loos are not encouraged and it appears everyone there is a guest.  The concierge services are excellent, housekeeping stellar, room service amazing.  Within 6 minutes of placing a call, a beautiful white linen cart with fresh flowers, English china, and delicious treats were delivered to the room.    High tea on a Sunday afternoon, Fabulous!

When we returned we were shown to the room - it was small but lovely and had been refurbished with a wet room. The only problem was I had seen myself soaking in the bath with the champagne that was waiting for us and the booking stated a bathroom. We contacted reception to enquire if we could have a room with a bath - no problem and we were taken to a lovely room overlooking the main street which felt so right.

Right around the corner is the metro and the lines are simple to learn and use. Breakfast at the Ritz is a buffet with individual menu options of eggs, breakfast breads and breakfast meats.

Breakfast was outstanding.  Scrambled eggs are delicious.  High tea was great and they went out of their was to accomodate us.

David S,86,74,Disappointed,[3.0],"I've left the ritz feeling like something was missing. I haven't been for sometime opting for the Taj or more modern hotels such as the savoy. While the quality is there, for the money it does lack a sense of attention to detail and friendliness.

Their service was impeccable with all staff ensuring there is nothing else that they can do for you. Yes it is more expensive but treat yourself one day. It is also important to note there is a strict dress code and so if you only had jeans like me after travelling for 4 weeks, you will not be able to enjoy the bar and restaurant in the afternoon/evening. The dress code I guess is part of the charm of the hotel. Try tea in your room and also enjoy their short bread.", September 2015,nan

Our raincoats were checked in by the reservation desk of the dinning hall. We were led to our table by the assistant manager of the restaurant, Mr. Isabella. We were treated with glasses of champgne, whic was not chilled enough. The wine list is enormous, however, the wine steward gave us few pointers. We chose our entrante a le carte and Beef Wellington. Both were exquiste in presentation and taste. It was a delight to see the presentation of desert, the crepe suzette, highly recommended. I know my teas, but theirs was just divine. The only place where they failed was in serving the wine; the wine was served right ouf of the bottle and not from a wine decanter. And that I found was bit out of carácter from a restaurant like Ritz. And yes keep your jacket on; I took it off purposely to prove to my companion and sure enough, one of the waiter immediately requested me to put it back on, Q.E.D.", September 2015, Travelled as a couple

The standard of cuisine is very high, but not exceptional. The five-star system can be watched and admired in action but then, the best systems are invisible to the customer.

Our room and the decor in general throughout the hotel could do with a facelift. However our room was spacious and the amenities good. At reception we were asked what time we would like the turndown service and we specified between 7-8pm. When we came back from dinner at 10:15 - the maid was in the room! Breakfast was awful - service was slow, waiters busy chatting to each other rather than attending to guests ( not just our table). Selection of buffet items was reasonable…", July 2015,nan

The formality, manners and general decorum befitting of the 1920's or 30's. It is quite simply perfect.I have always thought I do not belong in the harsh and brash era we live in today.

upintheair1987,18,26,Disappointing.,[3.0],"Our stay at the Ritz was disappointing given the reputation and price point. It's not unreasonable to expect when one makes a dinner reservation with concierge some months before arriving, that the reservation will be looked after and reconfirmed, as per the email advice from the Ritz concierge. Arriving at one of London's top and busiest restaurants, to be greeted with no record of a reservation is downright embarrassing and leaves one more than a little stranded.The concierge advised that they log their reservations and confirm the day before, especially difficult places. That would have been fine, but clearly there was never a reservation made in the first place, to re confirm.We were staying in a non smoking room, however other guests were smoking in the hallways, with their doors open, moving from room to room. It was evident that this was going on, and yet it prompted no reaction from management. On check out when i raised the issue, there was non response, as if it is something that occurs regularly.I would have thought given the mistake concierge made, that at the very least, there would have been an attempt for management to contact us whilst in residence at the hotel. The room we had was charming, and the location of the hotel is unbeatable, but service is everything in a hotel and ours was not up to scratch.", August 2015, Travelled as a couple

The second room made our stay value for money, the first room was over-priced and sub standard in my opinion. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.", July 2015,nan

pazthetaz,128,24,Outstandingly fabulous.,[5.0],"I absolutely adore The Ritz. I would not chance one single thing. Worth every penny. I highly recommend that if you never do anything else ever again that you make time to stay for even one night. Have breakfast in your Suite and a little later head for a massage. If you can have tea in the Palm Court with the harpist playing...Absolutely divine. I was made to live like that everyday and can guarantee I shall never miss work or home.If you have not stayed at the Ritz you really have not lived. The place takes on a totally different atmosphere...rather subdued but at the same time warm and reassuring. An air of good old fashioned elegance seem to seep out and the beauty of the place is simply captivating when there is noone else around. It is like having a great big old house to oneself after the staff have retired for the night. If you truly love someone take them to the Ritz. They will always remember how you made them feel. Take your time and make every minute count..but remember to breathe.Mother always says that when one does not ""see"" the staff is when everything is being done so effortlessly. Whoever trained the personnel have done so to perfection... whether at dinner or in the corridors the personnel were perfect in their attitude, etiquette and behaviour. None of them were over familiar as seems to happen so often nowadays in the other luxury hotels, yet after a couple of days it was good to be welcomed ""back""...so that all important personification was there.We cannot wait to return again and again.

Arrecife,77,133,50th Birthday Splendour and Opulence at its best,[5.0],"We have just returned from a stay at The Ritz London to celebrate my 50th birthday.From arrival at the entrance to closing the taxi door on departure, the whole thing was wonderful, magical and unforgettable.We had booked the Putting on The Ritz package for the celebration as this included Afternoon Tea and breakfast. Everything was waiting for us on arrival. Our bags were taken before we got to the reception desk, and we were invited to check in. The check in was quick and trouble free - they even mentioned it was my special birthday, and then escorted us to our room, explaining details about the hotel on the way.The room was way beyond my expectations. Every possible attention to detail had been given. There was a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake waiting for me, and the television was on and playing soothing, gentle music in the background. The amenities of the room were explained and we were then left to settle in, as our suitcase arrived in the room shortly after us.We showered and prepared for our Afternoon Tea, and the bathroom amenities were of excellent quality. The bath robes and towels so soft and fluffy you really felt wrapped in a haven of comfort. The complimentary toiletries were of the highest quality and felt so good on the skin as well as giving the most magical aromas.On going down to Afternoon tea, two doormen opened the doors into the long gallery and we arrived at the Palm Court to be greeted by name and shown immediately to our table. The menu was explained and we were left to peruse at our leisure. Our waiter then arrived to take the order for the tea, and returned with a pot of tea each. Our sandwiches and cakes then arrived, and these were explained by our waiter. Tea was then poured for us and we were left to enjoy the experience.As other reviewers have commented, waiting staff kept bringing more sandwiches and cakes and asking if we wanted anything further. The scones when they came were just something else - out of this world, and again they kept bringing more. Before the end of the experience, yet another waiter appeared at our table with a birthday cake for me with a candle in it which was lit, as the pianist played happy birthday - everyone clapped - and I shall never forget it - what a special way to spend a special birthday.The experience was over all too soon, but not before they had boxed my cake for me to take away. We then retired to our room, as we were very full! The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The quality of the linen was exceptional and I remember feeling that I did not want the experience to end.Breakfast the next morning was another magical experience. The food was of excellent quality and the service and attention to detail outstanding.Check out was handled efficiently and smoothly, and when we got to the door on departure a taxi was waiting for us.Sadly, the experience was over all too soon, but this was a stay I will never forget.The staff are without exception some of the most professional, courteous and helpful I have ever had the good fortune to encounter. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they have a special gift of making you feel extra special - all with effortless ease.This truly was a magical experience and a very memorable birthday treat. I will treasure it for ever, and I would love to return to The Ritz soon as their service and standards are poles apart from everywhere else. It thoroughly deserves it excellent reputation, and I would highly recommend it.  If you are thinking about it - don't think - do it - you will find it well worth it, and you will never forget it. We had a magical time and hope to return soon", July 2015, Travelled as a couple

JOAN D,67,52,"Fabulous, except for the speed!",[4.0],"We booked this for a special occasion - pre Royal Garden Party. I explained on booking we needed to finish the meal by a certain time. On the plus side, the surroundings were fantastic. Really opulent. The waiters tried to be attentive.  The food was delicious.  We only had one course, really, but were brought canapés to start, and little mini deserts to finish, which weren't charged for. So the bill for the main course was what we paid. That meant £86 for two, for a single course - but actually it felt like three courses, albeit the starters and deserts were set for us.  So it felt like quite good value. Unfortunately though, the main course took one hour to arrive, from order to service. This made the whole thing a little stressful, as I'd explained we wanted to be finished by a certain time. I'd hoped to at least have a main course and desert of our choosing, but there wasn't time. We also had to chase the waiters to get the good out after an hour. So, sadly this was a bit disappointing.  I saw others who were on their second course when we arrived, also waiting 1/2 hour or more between courses. So - had we had hours to spare this would have been perfect. Beautiful surroundings.  Gorgeous food.  A lovely way to idle away a few hours. But because I'd said on booking we wanted to keep to a set timescale - which I thought was reasonable - an hour and a half or so for lunch - but we only managed one ""real"" course in that time - I was a little disappointed.", May 2015, Travelled with family

Coccindy,198,99,"Fabulous stay, would definatley go back",[5.0],"First, this Ritz is NOT affiliated the the Ritz Carlton.  When we first arrived the lobby seemed small and a little dated.  This is an old world hotel!  The water wasnt working when we first checked in so our room wasnt going to be ready until the evening ( we had an overnight flight and had arrived to the hotel before 9 am.  We had requested early check in.  Once the realized we were going to move hotels they offered us a suite to suffice.  It was spacious and fabulous.  The food and service in the Hotel was unvelievable ( inspite of the mishap).  The private gambling area downstairs is available to guests.  The experience was outstanding.  Additionally the afternoon tea was really nice ( but you definately need a reservation snd coat and tie attire. ). I think its one of the most popular ones.   We saw several people turned away each day for too casual attire or no reservation.  The bar was small , well appointed and a very good energy.  The "" mixologist"" was amazing snd went out of his way to make the experience a memorable one.  The drinks were creative and delicious!The doormen all called you by name as you entered and exited and seemed to be the best .  Overall as long as you can spend the money, its a five star experience.  The location was also very convenient.", April 2015, Travelled with family

fredalynn,134,55,A good but not world class hotel,[4.0],"The service is excellent and the hotel is well maintained. What prevents it, in myopinion, from being a world class hotel like the Peninsula in Chicago or the FourSeasons in Boston is simply the age of the hotel. The plumbing is not as modernnor does it work as well (quietly)as it does in those hotels. Also, the noise level within theroom (at least in our suite) isn't as low as it is in more modern hotels (i.e., youcan at times hear the floor creak). If this were not a top level London hotel withaccompanying London prices I wouldn't be so demanding. But it is and I am.In summary, we still enjoyed our stay, appreciated the high level of service and would recommend it for people who are comfortable with a moderate to high degree of formality as we are. On that note, it was a pleasure to see the perfect posture of all the servers and bus people in the dining room.", May 2015, Travelled with family

Walt T,11,6,'Grande Dame' of London; Security Staff Lacks Manners,[4.0],"I would like to start by saying that this property is undoubtedly one of the most iconic hotels in London. The 'complete' experience is wonderful, and the hotel itself is enchanting. If you are looking for a 'modern' room (with all of the contemporary bells and whistles), look elsewhere. But for a 'traditional' English experience, complete with old world charm, give this property a try. The location is great. Now onto a major flaw in the Ritz experience. I recently visited the hotel, had dinner, and wanted to purchase a hotel souvenir for my nephew. The front desk advised me to walk to the second floor where I could browse the available items for sale in a glass curio. As I attempted to walk up the stairs, a security guard (very smug) abused his presumed 'power' by forcing us to come back down(stairs). I assured him that the front desk staff advised us to go upstairs to look at the products for sale, yet he very rudely, inappropriately, and quite frankly in an unpolished way, told us that the area was ""off limits."" While I certainly understand and appreciate any (and all) security procedures, the Ritz should be ashamed for not training staff to handle this type of situation more appropriately. This guy was obviously trained in a barn in the woods somewhere, and was quite unaware of how to interact with guests. So, this review is mainly for the hotel management. I do love the hotel, and would likely stay there again. But let's not forget: in these times of online reviews, customers expect to be treated well, and with dignity. And at a hotel like the Ritz, even the smallest of gestures may not be forgotten. So to the management: review your training, and offer a refresher course in the correct way to handle even the most banal of situations (i.e., ""Sir, please allow me to fetch someone to escort you to the second floor. It would be my pleasure."") Happy travels.", May 2015, Travelled with family

However, I soon found out that reservations were made months in advance.  Not to be put off, the charming doorman led us inside and said there was a restaurant across from the Tea Room that would be a great choice.  In we went.  It was just lovely.  As it was the November time frame they already have the Christmas decorations up with carol singers dressed in period costume.  The staff at The Ritz are friendly and helpful and we had a wonderful time with great food.  I didn't miss the tea at all with a lovely G&T to compensate!

Sadly - I had one of the worst hotel stays of my life at The Ritz London in May. I'll keep it brief - if you're under 50 and on a leisure vacation where you want to relax.... Don't stay here. It's stuffy and pretentious and the absolute opposite of modern, relaxing and welcoming. Oh, if you want afternoon tea make sure you pack a blazer and dress clothes/shoes. Because I certainly don't pack like that for vacation so we were not allowed to enter the tea room. Beyond the pretense, there was the construction, and having to wait hours for my room to be ready so it could be cleaned.... Yet...

The service we received from entering the building to leaving was excellent and the staff were so friendly.  We arrived early and were informed that the room wasn't yet ready but were offered complimentary tea in the Rivoli Bar whilst we waited.  We felt rather underdressed, as of course we hadn't expected to be sitting in one of the bars before freshening up!  We were well aware of the dress code in the hotel.  The maître d' at the entrance give us a quick second take but he recovered very quickly and showed us to a table.  The staff in the bar were lovely and put us at ease whilst serving us with tea and cinnamon shortbread.  I hate cinnamon but this particular shortbread was delicious, so light.  After we had finished the tea the receptionist showed us to our room and we were delighted, it was much bigger than we expected, the furnishings were lovely, very elegant in pastel colours.  The only slight disappointment was the view which was overlooking rooftops at the back of the hotel but everything else more than made up for this and the room was very quiet.  A bottle of champagne was included in our package and there was small birthday cake (which was delicious) and fresh flowers provided.  Dinner was included and we absolutely loved the dining room, everything in the hotel is so elegant.  The food was fabulous and beautifully presented, service impeccable, just couldn't fault anything, it was an amazing dining experience.

Afternoon Tea at its best !!!  you have to dress up, no jeans, trainers or casual wear which makes it even nicer.  The Palm Court, where tea is served is very plush. Once seated, your server introduces himself and looks after you from then on.. An array of teas to choose from and once you chosen, the tea is non stop. As soon as you cup is empty, you are poured another one (no pouring your own!!!!).  A very nice mixture of sandwiches, as fresh as can be, with a delicious selection of cakes arrives, then more sandwiches, and more if you want them. The cake selection is not you average afternoon tea, specialty Ritz cakes. Scones, still warm,  with cream and jam, and then a trolley arrives where you can choose to have a slice of cake cut. and still the tea is being poured. The staff can not do enough for you. Not sure of the cost for this as it was a gift, but if you want something special and memorable, then its definitely one to do. Parking is an issue at most hotels in London, but they do have valet parking at a fee of £20 for 3 hours (we were lucky on the day, as the valet had to park our car on the road near the hotel, so did not have to pay).

So I thought where better to stay than The Ritz! I booked us a Superior King Room with a ""Putting on The Ritz"" package, Which included Afternoon Tea in the beautiful Palm Court & dinner that evening in The Ritz restaurant.Whilst making the reservation over the phone, I told the bookings agent that I intended to propose to my girlfriend during our stay & that the whole trip was going to be a surprise. Something they did not forget!We arrived at The Ritz (much to my girlfriends surprise!!) around midday after a fairly quick trip from Oxford via the bus & underground. We were greeted by the kind doorman who took our overnight bag & directed us to the Hotels reception. We then recieved a very warm welcome from the very attentive & helpful receptionist. We were checked in swiftly, with all the details of our reservations read out & then offered a tour of the hotel before being shown to our room.We were located on the 2nd floor, in a beautifully decorated spacious room, with a large hanging chandelier & complimentary bottle of champagne to greet us. Shortly after entering our room, our bag was brought to us, by another one of The Ritz's efficient staff. After settling in, we had a couple of hours to kill before Afternoon Tea, so thought we would take a short wander across Green Park to see Buckingham Palace.We returned to the hotel, hungry & very much looking forward to the Afternoon Tea. We were shown to our table & then told what was on offer by one of the well trained waitors. Across the next hour & a half we were treated to, what seemed to be a endless supply of sandwiches, scones, cakes & tea, all delicious & like nothing we'd experienced before!Thankfully, our booking for dinner wasnt for another 4 hours once we had finished the Afternoon Tea, which was a blessing as we were both sufficiently full! So we once again retired back to our room and enjoyed the comforts the hotel has to offer. Later that evening, we made our way down to The Ritz's restaurant, to again be amazed by the quality and luxury of the hotel. We both enjoyed 3 delicious courses & whilst dining, was entertained by a live band & pair of professional dancers.After dinner, we visited the famous Rivoli bar, as my now Fiance is a cocktail enthusiast! We were once again, shown to a table & had our order taken. The famous Tallulah cocktail was what my Fiance ordered, and she was more than pleased with how it was presented and tasted. Shortly after finsihing our drinks, we thought we would visit The Ritz club & casino. So we rang the doorbell & the mirrored door was opened & we were shown down the stairs towards the Casino. Neither of us having a clue about gambling, we werent to fussed about that side of it, but just wanted to have a good look around.We then, around midnight, went back to our room & enjoyed a good nights sleep on the comfy bed, which was dressed with petals in the shape of a heart upon our return. Another nice touch!The following morning, we went back downstairs to The Ritz's restaurant to enjoy the complimentary breakfast, which was another delightful experience! Shortly after, We returned to our room to pack & then check out, as our wonderful stay had sadly come to an end!PRO'S ABOUT THE RITZ:* All the staff are extremely well trained & literally cannot do enough for you. We were amazed by how attentive they were & how your made to feel like royalty!* The Hotels grounds are beautiful, Immaculate and tastefully decorated.* It may seem a lot of money, but it is well worth it.

What she didn't expect however, was that we were staying at possibly the best hotel in the world! From the moment we stepped up to the front door the service was outstanding, very welcoming and friendly staff took our bags and ushered us kindly to the reception desk where we could check in. The girls behind the desk were so lovely and they asked what had brought us to London, I told them about the surprise for my wife's birthday (who was still laughing in shock) and a couple of the girls disappeared for a few moments and on their return had presented my wife with a small present form the hotel, this blew me away! Although we had arrived at 10am I knew we couldn't check in until 2pm (as is the same for most hotels) so they kindly kept our bags (no charge to my delight) until our room was ready.  Yet again they blew me away by offering us breakfast free of charge for the morning! I hadn't booked the breakfast as I had just saved enough for the room only, (this isn't the kind of hotel I could afford all the time lol ) so they offered me to sign up for the ""leaders club"" which earned us the continental breakfast free for our stay, yet again you could imagine how pleased I was at this.  We hadn't even checked into our room yet and already I knew this place was special.  When we were ready to go to our room we were taken on a tour of the hotel and brought to the room by a lovely girl called Tara (sorry if I got the spelling wrong).  The room was beautiful and the hotel had even delivered a birthday cake for my wife upon our arrival to the room, everything about this place is perfect and if we could stay here every time we would.  We didn't get to enjoy the bar or evening meals as yet again, my budget didn't stretch that far, but I can clearly say without doubt this is the best hotel experience I have ever had and gladly give The Ritz London 5 stars for everything!

TheCypriotAficionado,13,3,A hotel which offer much more than what hotel usually offer...,[5.0],"From the very moment someone enters the Ritz he is amazed not only by the extravagant and luxurious surroundings but also from the very professional staff and the ambiance surrounding the whole history of the hotel, every detail is carefully taken care of, from the very polite staff, each room boasts its own unique furniture many of which are original antique pieces. The Ritz is a must for anyone visiting London, either to enjoy its well known afternoon tea, or its varied breakfast. Of course dinner at the Ritz is an other experience on its own, as a visitor has the opportunity to dine in Europe's most extravagant and ornate dinning room. The dishes are served with a lot of detail and I highly recommend crepes suzettes for dessert. (Treat yourself to a Ritz 100 cocktail in the rivolli bar and you will never forget it). In all ways, The Ritz is undoubtably an institution on its own and is an essential visit for someone wanting to experience being served and pampered to the full...", May 2015,nan

SBF.Dublin,58,49,The hotel lives up to its reputation - a super experience,[5.0],"We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world, so I asked myself what made this hotel special in comparison to these others and I can honestly say it was the staff.  From the moment we arrived, from the doorman, and in particular Antoinella, on the front desk, as all the staff were helpful, friendly, efficient and ""human"".  We experienced this same attitude and willingness to help from all the staff who came across as being proud of the place they worked in. They remembered our name as we passed through the hotel, even though we were only staying 2 nights. This was that added extra.  Yes the room was as expected and very comfortable and everything looked great.  The main lobby, restaurant etc all looked super, but its that personal touch that made the difference. A good example was that I mentioned in passing when registering at the front desk with Antoinella, that  it was my husbands birthday.  A couple of hours later a birthday cake was delivered to the door, complimentary.  We were very impressed that this small piece of information was picked up on and acknowledged. I would love to visit the Ritz again, but I will keep it for that special occasion. As this is a special hotel in the heart of London. The location is excellent.", March 2015, Travelled as a couple

The Scones were lovely but i felt lacked that buttery taste. Not sure about the ""Clotted Cream"" tasted good but looked and tasted like very creamy butter.I personally think The Ritz Afternoon Tea are living off their reputation and might need a gentle kick up the backside.Instead of concentrating on getting as many people as possible into the tea room maybe look at the quality of what your charging for.", May 2015, Travelled as a couple

Lawyergirl25,167,122,Divine stay,[5.0],"Stayed for 1 night on Sat 25 April as we were in town to watch the London Marathon. They e-mailed in advance to ask what time we would arrive and sure enough when we turned up at 1pm, they were waiting for us. The whole check-in process was smooth, elegant and as expected. Our room on the 5th floor was very big and very well appointed. Lots of fluffy towels, and everything we could ask for. Ice bucket already stocked. Again, very impressive. I usually struggle to sleep when away from home but this room & bed was so comfy I got my full 8 hours of sound sleep. For me - this is amazing! We had drinks later that evening in the Ravoli bar and a bottle of champagne in the Ritz club. I preferred the bar (more quaint) and the cocktail was beautiful. Breakfast next morning was impressive. Choice of refreshments and good choice of buffet. We were very happy and all dished up by Ritz butlers in their fineary. I liked the fact that people had to make some effort in their appearence for breakfast as we were told the dress code did apply. Checkout again was very smooth. Only mishap was an incorrect charge had been placed on our tab (£170) but it was obvious that it was a mistake and immeditely removed with no hassle at all. We returned later in the day to collect our luggage and had a family member with us who had just ran the London marathon. Staff came out to congratulate him and despite him looking like he had just run a marathon (because he had!) we weren't made to feel that we should not be and the whole service and positive attitude rang throughout the place. I fear now that anywhere else will simply not match up and the next time we're in London, I'll be looking to book again. There really is no place like it and of course we all want to be ""putting on the Ritz"".", April 2015, Travelled as a couple

No fuss was made about anything, all the food was perfect and the room was more than we expected. We had afternoon tea which does have an enforced dress code. But, it's easy, don't try to break the rules and you won't have a problem. Suit and tie for blokes, smart clothes for women. Dresses, skirts or trousers seemed fine as long as it was smart.

Spirited15,19,43,Iconic venue,[5.0],"I have been lucky to stay at The Ritz twice recently; both times were fantastic - I will try to sum up my experience by relating the 'excellent' and perhaps 'not so excellent' aspects.The 'excellent' - the public areas, the service from all the staff (but especially the restaurant and reception teams are superlative); food is fantastic and I defy anyone to find a better breakfast service in London.  Music and entertainment on weekend evenings were really enjoyable.  Afternoon tea - amazing.The 'not so excellent' - I feel ambivalent about the rooms, the decor is lovely and it feels very luxurious...BUT on the top floor the water pressure is really poor, so I struggle to have a decent shower (in either of the Suites I've stayed in) - I think given the price (at roughly £1000+ per night, there really should be a power shower in every room.  I appreciate the building is old, but these days there should be some way of boosting the water pressure.  For me this was the biggest bugbear...The suites on the Piccadilly side of the hotel pick up a great deal of road noise (cars, sirens and beeping) - this goes on throughout the night - so soundproofing seems to be a problem.  I was fairly philosophical about this as you are in central london - which is noisy so.......There was also noise from the air con units (which are on the roof).In addition to the above - I dislike the (fairly common) practice of taking preauthorised amounts from your bank account - in my case this exceeded the actual bill; and that amount remains ring fenced from your balance until the hotel corrects it....however I understand this happens at a lot of large hotels so I'm resigned to it.Ultimately, and despite my minor grumbles the overall experience of the Ritz is fabulous and I do feel that some of the staff have become friends.  It is an iconic hotel and offers a real 'once in a lifetime' service  and I do love staying there.", April 2015, Travelled with family

brewcrew657,4,15,Good until a snag at the end,[2.0],"Recently I stayed at the Ritz with my parents who were there for 10 days while I joined them halfway through. During my stay my parents and I were extremely impressed by the overall service of the hotel who went above and beyond to get you whatever you wanted or desired. After the stay I left for a three week backpacking trip around Europe without my parents. I had left a single bag with the porter to hold onto until I got back to London after the trip. I arrived back at the ritz after my journey and had 4 hours until my train. So, I asked if I could leave my very heavy backpack along with my other bag for a mere 2 hours so I could go shopping for a little while not having to carry it around. I was extremely disappointed when I asked a young man if I could do so and without thinking a second said no. After keeping a bag for three weeks a hotel such as this should be able to fulfill a tiny request to hang onto another for a tiny while longer, however after experiencing this unpleasant service my original feelings on an amazing stay were tarnished. I find it unfortunate that the majority of the staff are willing to go above and beyond for a customer but some are very inexperienced and could not handle something like this smoothly. After leaving I went to another hotel down the street where my family is rewards members and was allowed to leave my bag no questions asked.

There were no full length mirors in our junior suite,  nowhere comfortable near mirrors for a woman to blowdry her hair.  The electricity points are all for UK plugs and the hotel's solution is to sell you one adapter from their minibar.  We needed to plug in several telephones and computers..  The decor in our room was attractive enough - a little drab - .and on the day we arrived,  the lift and one area of the hotel on the ground floor where they serve their afternoon tea smelt absoutely ghastly - we stayed well away.

We went one better and booked for lunch!The worry is, that when you have looked forward to something for so long, will it meet with your expectations? What if it is all hype? What if you end up expensively disappointed?Fear not. This experience is one of a lifetime and worth every penny!There is a strictly applied dress code and so we arrived smartly attired, but that just made the whole experience so much more enjoyable.The welcome we received was extremely polite with the receptionist making pleasant small talk whilst showing us to the restaurant. There is no, ""the restaurants that way"" at the Ritz - you are shown to your meal from the moment you enter!Our booing was politely confirmed before we were accompanied to our table and politely seated. Our waiter, smartly presented in black tie, tails and waistcoat, introduced himself and presented us with our menus. We booked via an on line offer and so the menu was one of three set choices for the starter, main course and dessert.We elected to have cocktails as aperitifs. They were not included in the deal and were £19 each but how often are you going to enjoy the experience? In for a penny... The choice of cocktail was huge and would suit any preference. They were priced from £19 up to and beyond £100 each. They were absolutely wonderful and worth having.Hors D oeuvres were complimentary and melt in the mouth delicious.The meal in itself was unbelievably delicious. I know you expect something a little bit special here but you will still be in awe of the chef's skill. The presentation was beautiful and even before tasting the food, the aromas from it reported its quality.I have a keen interest in cookery and enjoy a reasonable skill level in the kitchen but I was humbled by the subtle explosion of taste experience I enjoyed from every course. I chose the goose liver (a firm pate), fillet of halibut and tropical souffle for my meal and savoured every divine mouthful.Petit Fours were again complimentary and the coffee (charged extra) was rich and strong.The attentive staff were incredibly polite and took time to explain each course as it was served. Our enjoyment was checked at regular intervals and obviously with a genuine interest in making sure our experience was everything it should be.The service charge is NOT included in your bill, but the service you receive is worthy of a respectful reward.I could go on, but I can sum up by saying - this is a well known bucket list item.

Upon arrival our bags were taken straight from the Taxi and were put in our room for us; they were there by the time we had checked in! All the staff were extreamly friendly and addressed you by your last name (we were called by our name by the front of house staff every time we saw them).  After checking in we were shown a tour of where to find the restraunts, Palm court and the bar and then shown personally to our room.The room was amazing.  The room was very glamerous but you could see that it had retained many qualities and features from when it was first opened.  The room was immaculate and the bathroom housed an array of Osprey toiletries (these had been restocked again after we returned from dinner and the same with our towels).  We also both had a pair of slippers and a robe which was a nice touch.  As it was my birthday they had put a birthday cake in the room along with a card.  We thought this was a very nice touch and made it seem all that more personal.  The bed was extreamly comfortable and we both wanted to take the pillows with us! We did not hear any noise while we were there (no noisy room next door), however, the only downfall was that our room did not exactly have a view as it was only of a stairwell.....we stayed in room 123 so would definately not be good if you are expecting a nice view!We also ate in the resturant in the veneing which we both found amazing.  We had to pay extra each as there was a dance show and a band but it was definately worth it.The whole experience was amazing and won't be forgotton in a hurry.

Luxurystayer,12,17,"fantastic stay, room service left a little to be desired.",[3.0],"Would have given this hotel 5 stars if it wasn't for the grumpy room service. Had a fantastic stay last weekend. Reception were wonderful, room was spotless, and doormen were fabulous. From stepping out of the car and into the lobby I knew I was in for a great stay. The reception, room, restaurant and concierge staff were very professional and made my son feel like a king. I cannot praise them enough.Breakfast was the best that I had ever had. Attention to detail was first class. The breakfast waiters were top notch, polite, smart and attentive. The Rivoli bar staff were very helpful and even advised us on which cocktail to have. Tea at the ritz was up to its usuaul outstanding service. The waiters couldn't do enough for my son. Our main waiter was excellent as per usual. He deserved his tip ten times over!However; my son called room service for his 'kids at the ritz' free ice cream and was treated rather rudely, being cut off mid sentence and rather rudely rushed. This is not what I expect from what is probably one of the of the world's best hotels. It was a treat for my son, not me, and to receive this level of service is not what I expected. The hot tap on the second sink didn't work, so I had to share a sink with my son. There was a distinct lack of cookies and milk on turndown as described in the 'kids at the ritz' literature. My son had to call down to room service and they brought him up a few digestives. Perhaps my idea of cookies is different to that of room service! I was expecting 'cookies' not a few dry McVities! He looked really dissapointed at rhe selection, and I din't blame him.When reception were told of the issues they were not happy, and apologised for the hotels short comings. As stated, would have given them 5 dots instead of 3 but sone of the niggles didvspoil the stay somewhat.

This must be THE best Hotel in London. As we pulled up at the Ritz A very smart doorman was waiting and arranged for our bags to be taken to our room and a valet took away our car to be safely parked on site overnight. When we checked in we were told that we had been upgraded from a Deluxe King room to a Junior Suite.We were then given a tour of the hotel facilities by a very pleasant young lady who afterwards showed us to our Suite.The suite was fantastic, the bathroom included a walk in shower as well as a bath and a his and hers sink and a full range of Asprey toiletries, not to mention the robes hanging on the back of the door. After unpacking we wandered into the Rivoli bar and treated ourselves to a Lobster sandwich and a pot of tea.We were booked into the Ritz restaurant for 7-30pm and as we arrived we were welcomed by another very polite member of staff and shown to our table which overlooked the park. The restaurant is a magnificent place to eat and the waiters make you feel special. After a look at the menu I decided to try the veal and my wife had the Lobster,Without exception this meal was the best we have ever tasted and for dessert we thought we would have the crepes. These were prepared at our table by our waiter and was a spectacle to watch, they tasted wonderful.After our meal we wandered into the Ritz Club,which as a guest of the Ritz you can enter from the hotel and we tried our luck at the Blackjack tables.The Casino looks like the one from from the film Casino Royale and all that was missing was James Bond.When we returned to our room we could not believe it. The staff had covered the bed with red rose petals in the shape of a heart and put comfy slippers by our bed.The hotel knew that we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and went the extra mile to make our stay special I forgot to mention that in our room we were also pleased to find a bottle of champagne,a lovely fresh cream and fruit iced cake,a box of Ritz chocolates. a bowl of fresh fruit and flowers.the management and staff at the Ritz make this a very special hotel and if you ever get the opportunity to stay here please try it,It really is Fantastic", April 2015, Travelled as a couple

Bread? If you were nut allergy like me you will ended up with plain gluten free bread.... The presentation of the food and service was formidable I will say beyond my expectations.

I order porridge it wasn't cooked properly or enough time. Croissants? Very nice! Cappuccino? No thanks! You need to get proper cappuccino cups you certainly won't produce a good coffe in a tea cup or any nice cup. I had just filter as I asked twice for cappuccino and it wasn't wrigth so I just gave up.

More expensive than most, if not all other places I looked at booking but to be honest, none of them compared while I was looking online and so it had to be The Ritz. From the minute we arrived, the staff were faultless, attentive and helpful. The atmosphere and ambience were second to none other that we have experienced. The food and drink, again, the best. I could go in to detail but to be honest, there is no need. It sells itself and does not disappoint. We had champagne with our afternoon tea and I'm not usually a champagne drinker but when in Rome... and I must say, I'm converted (but only to the more expensive and finer champagne that the likes of The Ritz provide).

Sharon J,92,31,Very special,[5.0],"Stayed here for 2 nights last week, with my husband, as a special break: we hadn't been away together without our son in the 13 years he has been with us! It did not disappoint from the moment that the Doorman greeted us and our meagre 2 bags were whisked away. All members of staff were welcoming, polite and friendly. Very ornate entrance, restaurant, bar etc and magnificent flower arrangements. Our room was spotlessly clean: yes the gold taps are a little faded but the Hotel has over a hundred years of history and wouldn't be the same if it was completely changed. The bed was wonderfully comfy, making for 2 good nights sleep. We had booked the kitchen tour and a cocktail demonstration and I'm so glad we did. I'd expected to be in a group, but, no, it was just the 2 of us. The chef who showed us around (I believe he was 2nd Sous & 3rd in command) showed us all areas, we could ask him anything and he was super friendly and enthusiastic. The freshly made selection of canapes we were presented with (along with a glass of Champagne) were wonderful (especially the tuille cone of smoked salmon and the sweet tuille filled with Coranation chicken). I felt honoured to have seen behind the scenes! Equally the cocktail demonstration in the Rivoli bar on the second day, was wonderful! Again it was just for the 2 of us. We learnt a lot from our bartender and first sampled the Ritz 100 cocktail, then the Tallulah cocktail complete with glass shoe (& yes, I drank some from that)  & finally one of our choosing: I chose the Horse & Hounds while my husband had one specially concocted for him. Felt very relaxed by the end: thankfully we were eating in the Restaurant that night as I'm not sure I could have gone far! The meal in the restaurant was also beautifully presented and delicious. Only a couple of tiny niggles: our toast at breakfast (fabulous buffet spread and cooked breakfast choices) the 2nd day was slightly overcooked (a bit singed on the edges and dark, not burnt,  so didn't send it back, but surprised it came out of the kitchen) and the coffees that we ordered on arrival in our room didn't turn up for about an hour, when we had gone off to our kitchen tour, so found it there on our return.

JB30,159,166,Once in a lifetime...,[4.0],"The spec sheet for the Ritz isn't all that special. There are few facilities, there are not even that many rooms. The lobby and long room are always busy (with restaurant and afternoon tea guests), so there are not even many quiet lounges to relax in, but it's the Ritz!The room we stayed in, a Superior King had plenty of space, was furnished as you would expect, there was even someone waxing our door when we arrived - how many hotels do that? The bathroom was in keeping with the rest of the hotel, therefore I have experienced better (more modern) facilities.Service was very good. A cake was waiting for my Wife for her birthday when we arrived in the room. The door staff have a tough job, vetting snoopers and distinguishing between afternoon tea/restuarant guests and hotel residents. My mother in law was in a wheel chair and the choice was being lifted up the steps (not very dignified) or entering through the car park, not ideal, but that was made up by the fact that she managed to get one of the accessible rooms, which was great as it had two bathrooms, one normal and one accessible.We had breakfast one morning which was superb, a buffet does not have to be huge if it has the right items and the right quantities, regularly topped up. Afternoon tea in the Palm court was interesting, the venue is amazing but I have had both better quality and better service elsewhere.So finally we come to money, well everyone knows it is expensive, but it is the Ritz and everyone should go there at least once, if they have the opportunity.", October 2014, Travelled with family

Simon is the very special head of the gorgeous, glamorous restaurant and his beady eye  catches everything and everyone. He demands first class service from his staff and we benefit from his high level of professionalism. The food is always great with interesting menus artistically served.  Afternoon tea seems very high onLondon tourist lists and i believe they do 7 sittings some days, with and without champagne.  As a resident you can use the casino down stairs but dont expect much going on until after midnight, but certainly an experience if only to watch and have a drink.   But saving the best until last.

The architecture and design had me in awe. It was something out of a movie. It's also in a perfect location and area. Breakfast was great, you get to have breakfast each morning in the Palm Court which I cannot begin to describe how beautiful it is. The food is all so good! The staff are amazing, they are all so hard working and their work is exceptional. I had the privilege of getting to know a couple of employees, who at the end of the day, felt more like family. I have to mention a few: David, Manuel, Salvatore, Antonella, Allison, Manolo (I still want to know his secret of staying so energized! Never seen anyone so energetic each morning and evening), Giuseppe, Francesco, Steven. And many more who I didn't get the chance of meeting. (I apologize if I didn't spell the names correctly). The hotel has a Salon, I recommend anyone staying at the hotel to try it out. Hannah does the best massages so make sure to book one with her! (You'll probably end up going more than once)Charlotte does the best mani/pedi's, I've been to a lot and I have to say she does it the proper way. Just make sure you go early bc it will take you a while to choose a colour.Nicole does the best hair! (I've said best too many times but bear with me) Tea time! I highly recommend you try that out. You have quite a selection of teas, you're then presented with a three tier silver tray of cute sandwiches and sweets. Night at the Ritz - also highly recommended to attend. I don't need to mention that the food's great. The entertainment was great, the dancers are amazingly talented. It's a lot of fun!Make sure you see the Casino, the architecture and design down there is beautiful. It's something one should definitely see.

Lots of good restaurants close by.  The hotel is of course lovely in an old world way and the afternoon tea is not to be missed.  Concierge is truly amazing.  This was our second time staying at the hotel.  Our room was beautiful however the shower was a bit of a challenge - truly tiny space and alternated between freezing cold and boiling hot. We stayed five nights and had a really nice time. Only VERY negative experience was our arrival. Our room was not ready so we had to wait although they offered us a different room for a higher charge that they could let us into right away.  We had just got off a transatlantic flight, but my husband and I thought that we did not need a better room than we had booked so we said we would wait. Over two hours later (and over an hour after their listed check-in time) we were not so happy when the lady at front desk was exceptionally rude when we asked when we would be able to get into our room. I should point out that we booked on the hotels website, were staying for five days and were not staying in a basic room type nor getting a ""great rate"". I think this person should question her career choice if she cannot be pleasant to people and is in the hospitality industry. We finally were upgraded to a different room and a very nice lady showed us to it. (I believe this was the room we were offered for additional money earlier.) We told her about the exceptional rudeness of the other lady but I got the impression that she did not want to know. We stayed five nights. Hotels such as this one should really focus on the arrivals experience as I have to say there are plenty of other luxury hotels in the area.  The RItz is a great old hotel though. We travel a lot and usually spend about about a week in London every year.", November 2014, Travelled as a couple

However, upon arrival we were immediately put at ease by the young lady on reception.  From then on we enjoyed every moment.  As was to be expected the room and food were top class, but what really made the stay exceptional was the attitude of all the staff who made us feel important and welcome, but not in too obvious a manner.  In particular we were impressed with the restaurant staff. Thank you for the birthday wishes and cake!", March 2015, Travelled as a couple

It reminded me very much of The Winter Palace in Luxour Eygpt. My Daughter was very very happy.....which was all I wanted....... Champage, a cake and Ritz Chocolates just  beautiful lovingly arranged on a table with silverware. A quick change and we went down for afternoon tea. The Palm Court where afternoon tea was served was absolutely gorgeous chandeliers, mirrors, luxurious surroundings. Excellent array of sandwiches, cakes, marvellous selection of teas from around the world and a nice selection of Champagne. The Ritz special blend tea was very good and complemented the wonderful afternoon tea. The staff were immaculately dressed and had prefect manners to match. In the evening we had booked a table so that Caroline could try the ""Tallulah  cocktail"".... named after a a 1950 Actress .,,it was brilliant ....the cocktail was in a perfume atomiser, you removed the lid and poured it into a bespoke Christian Loubitun glass shoe then drank it from the heel .... Well worth £20 each. After a wonderful evening at the West End Show Di, Vyv & Rose we returned to our Executive Kingsize Room ... The Bed had been turned down, slippers, bottle water and the Evening Standard ... Just brilliant and the room tidied. Just a bit cold at night should have asked for more blankets.In the morning Breakfast was served in the stunning main restaurant it was amazing ...such a beautiful restaurant. The presentation of the fresh Salmon alone was excellent.... Having been lucky enough to have stayed  in some of the most beautiful hotels all over the World and suites on The QM 2, Royal Carribean ...

The Ritz is the poshest, most extravagant place I have ever been, and yet the staff make you feel completely at home, and treat you like Royalty. The sandwiches, scones and cakes were all delicious (I swear the Orange macaron was singularly THE most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth) as was the tea. Apparently the Ritz own blend is great, I had the Earl Grey, a seemingly unlimited supply, served in solid silver teapots into proper china cups. I imagined there might not be too much to eat, but I couldn't have been more wrong, the sandwich plates were well loaded, and re-filled by the ever-attentive waiters until basically you have had as many as you want. And they really are good sandwiches. All in all, tea was excellent. Expensive, yes, but 100% worth it for the whole experience. You will love it, and like me you will be looking forward to next time.

The staff are incredibly welcoming, attentive and helpful. The decor is beautiful and I absolutely loved the harpist playing throughout my afternoon tea. I opted to have champagne and it was delicious. I couldn't manage to eat all the sandwiches, cakes and scones, each of them the best I have ever had. I don't think I could have another scone with clotted cream and jam again and not compare it at all to what they serve here. I couldn't even squeeze in another cake when more choices were brought round on the cake trolley! I loved the menu of teas you could try and I would recommend the Moroccan mint tea, absolutely refreshing and delicious! I would definitely come back again and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking of coming here. I just wish there more choices on offer to buy a little keep sake before I left.

I have to say the concierge staff and bellboys were brilliant! So were the bar staff and also those in the restaurant . However, the room was not the one  she asked for and so we were very dependant on staff to get us down to the lobby, or anywhere , really. At a cost of tip, obviously. The bedroom was large as was the bathroom, but the shower was too small to fit her chair. And not thermostated. The food was great. The continental breakfast was fine and well presented. The restaurant food was good but not exceptional and there was a raging draught by the window tables.But it is a great place, for a price.On my own account - someone gave me an overnight stay there as a gift. It turned out it wasn't so much a gift voucher as a non refundable room they bought but couldn't use. and neither have I been able to use it. the reservations people seem to require so many confirmations and apply such restrictions I wonder whether it is worth the bother.....", March 2015, Travelled with friends

One was an American CEO flying in and the other a Greek national actually working as a banker in London. It was something I will always remember. The heritage, luxury and quality is certainly second to none and just oozes from every crevice. Myself and my two friends had a 4 course dinner which was splendid.

Cookiemonster171,588,430,Great staff save the day,[4.0],"The attitude of the staff at the Ritz is excellent and they're great at putting things right but I would be more impressed if things went right to start with. A requested early check in turns into a long wait in the bar. When we get I to the room, the suitcase doesn't arrive right away. We can't go to the restaurant because we're in our travel clothes and you need to be in a jacket and tie. When it arrives we quickly get changed but not quickly enough. We get to the restaurant and the lunch menu has finished and we're asked to choose from the burger orientated bar menu. Hmmmm. Not quite what we expected. Having explained the situation, the manager rustles up a chef and the lunch menu is back on the cards. And it was lovely made even lovelier by the fact that they didn't charge us for the food. See what I mean about the staff?We were persuaded by the wonderfully helpful young man on reception to upgrade to a suite but is smelled very badly of stale tobacco. You'd wonder why housekeeping couldn't detect this themselves. Did it really need a customer to tell them about it? Anyway they moved us quite seamlessly into a better suite and put right the initial frustration. They're good at this. There were a few other instances but I won't bore you with them ( an English breakfast without bacon anyone?)What were the rooms like?We had a suite which was quite nice but on the small side. It seems like they aren't made for anyone over 6'. Was it my imagination or were the beds a little short? Same with the sofa in the lounge. No satellite TV. No tea and coffee maker - yes I know we have room service but I'd quite like to get up and watch the news in the lounge and make myself a cuppa at the same time. Calling room service and waiting for a £7 cup of tea isn't quite the same. Would we return. Well it's certainly a grand place in a superb location but maybe they need to become a little more efficient before I'd consider it good value compared with the other grand London hotels.", November 2014, Travelled as a couple

Some staff I found to be obnoxious and never acknowdged your presence, this was only some.Breakfast both mornings took 30 minutes on the second morning my daughters order was wrong. I felt those who often frequent the hotel were looked after rather than someone new, funny as money is all the same.

We were asked what time we wanted a turn down service and were escorted to the Trivoli Bar to wait. We decided to order lunch and a drink. The service was very poor. The waitress argued with my wife over the wine she had ordered. She kept interrupting while we were eating. She took my plate away before my wife had finished and when I pointed out that we had not got a room number for the bill she growled ""just print your surname""No one came for us but we wandered back to reception and got our key and was escorted to our room by a teenage member of staff. Our bags had not arrived. Another wait. The room itself was very tired but clean, faded orange and creams. The bathroom was marble but reminded me of something from a Victorian Hospital. A three course dinner in the main restaurant was included as part of the simply Sunday Package. Unfortunately it was not explained that the choice was not from the main menu but from an A3 size laminated piece of card. The service seemed to match the package we were on. Both starter and main courses were tepid. The hot breakfast the next morning was cold despite very few guests in the restaurant. It turns out that the kitchens are on a lower floor some distance from the restaurant. After the waiter spilling the wine without apology we decided to call it a night. Back to the room to find no turn down service. Phoned house keeping and left our room and wandered about the hotel while our room was serviced. On our return the house keeper was finishing and with out doubt she was the most pleasant person we talked to at during our stay at the RitzThe Ritz hotel invited me to fill in an on line survey to which I recieved an email with an apology offering a room upgrade and a bottle of champagne for our next visit.

MannyG2000,"1,176",754,Coasting on the name,[3.0],"There is no doubt that the restaurants and public areas are spectacular, virtually unequalled by any other hotel in the world in terms of gilded opulence. The Meurice in Paris, the original Peninsula, and the Four Seasons Geneva, among hotels I've seen recently, don't come close.However, the rooms are just not up to the price they charge. The bathroom is small, about 6 square meters tops, is somewhat dated, and has only a bathtub (no separate shower stall, which to me is non-negotiable for a grand luxe hotel). Soundproofing is poor; I could hear a lot of street noise from Piccadilly St., and the floor above me, century-old wood, creaked constantly.Checkin was pleasant and well-managed. Afterwards, though, front desk was shoddy (as I approached to ask for my room key after dining out, the clerk eyed me coldly and decided to ignore me and hope I would go away; after an uncomfortable half-minute, I had to speak up to ask for the key; in case hotel management cares, he was very tall and had red hair, on duty around 9 pm March 6). Service at breakfast was passable but nobody has taught the staff that ""no problem"" is not an appropriate response to a guest request for coffee (see Danny Meyer on this exact subject), nor has anyone told the staff that they are not supposed to sing out loud in the dining area, in earshot of guests having breakfast.", March 2015, Travelled solo

s a,265,159,Amazing hotel,[5.0],"I live in London, Surrey and have been to the Ritz on a few occasions but only for afternoon tea and the bars we had the most amazing time.But this time we stayed in the hotel over night, first I must say the staff are amazing our room was fantastic the restaurant is the best in London.Only thing that I must point out which I think let's the hotel down - no tea or coffee facilities in the room, I know this sounds like I am having a moan and the management will say you can use room service, but I did not want someone banging on my door at 7.00am in the morning while I am in bed, so come on Ritz let the guests have a free cup of tea I am sure you can afford to let your guests have a little privacy and make our own tea/ coffee.So that's my moan - but I must say this is a fantastic hotel and if you want a very special treat this is the place.Tell your bank manager you are going to the Ritz and may visit the Casino.

Gunther s,6,11,The place that I would most like to visit,[5.0],"I would like to take afternoon tea at The  Ritz but unfortunately I am an old age pensioner and I cannot afford to but I will imagine that I have been to The Ritz for afternoon tea and I will give it an imaginary review as to how I expect it would be. "" On arriving at The Ritz my companion and I were shown to the best table in the dining room. The table had on it a spotless white Irish Lawn Linen tablecloth embroidered with flowers and foliage and set upon the table was an exquisite bone china tea service which was both elegant and beautiful in it's delicacy and the solid silver cutlery shone delightfully with the reflection of the magnificent illuminated chandeliers that adorned the lavishly decorated ceiling. After a few minutes given to settling ourselves and marvelling at the magnificent decor of our surroundings the waiter arrived to greet us and take our order. The waiter was very smartly dressed and he was very friendly and affable and extremely courteous and helpful. After taking our order he disappeared behind a pair of lavish and ornately decorated pair of swing doors to reappear just a few moments later with our order which he brought to us on a silver coloured tea trolley. The waiter served us with the most delicate salmon and cucumber sandwiches which had the crusts removed and when we had consumed these delicious offerings we were served the most delicious array of cream cakes that I have ever had the pleasure to have sampled. During the course of this veritable feast we were supplied with copious amounts of Earl Grey tea which my colleague and I had previously chosen from the vast assortment that there was on offer. After a sublime and wonderful never to be forgotten experience we sadly departed the luxurious ambience that we he had experienced for the last two exquisite hours and it was sadly time to rejoin the ranks of the mere mortals that were thronging the vicinity of Piccadilly. I shall never forget my wonderful afternoon of pampering and spoiling myself when I was privileged to partake of Tea at The Ritz."" Unfortunately I shall not be able to write a review of this wonderful experience because, as I said before, it is only a dream because as I am an old age pensioner I sadly cannot afford to indulge in this kind of luxury. As I sit here at home writing this imaginary review while drinking my mug of P.G. Tips and eating my chocolate biscuit I imagine that I am there at The Ritz basking in it's sumptious surroundings. Oh if there was only a way that I could actually experience my lifelong dream.", March 2015, Travelled with friends

We were seating at the entrance of the afternoon tea seating area which was a little off putting. We were offered champagne which we decided to have and our tea was brought by shortly after which eventually got cold by the time the champagne was finished. On top of that my tea was poured before I had a chance to object (my friend said she wanted her tea but I was not asked and it was assumed that I also wanted mine). It was difficult to understand the waiting staff as they had very strong accents and one almost looked annoyed when we asked him to repeat what he said. The ladies loos are located down a small flight of stairs with no door but expected their to be a bit of privacy however a gentleman who worked at the ritz came through the ladies loos to get a store of bottled water.

We have tried this numerous times when we have stayed at the ritz but have never managed to get one, however they upgraded us to a beautiful suite!  The room was lovely, the only fault being that the shower head on the bath was a little erratic and splashed all over. This is the only negative and was a manageable problem. It definitely did not detract from the overall experience of the room nor the hotel. Breakfast was faultless, with a choice of menu or buffet there was something for everyone. I've never had fruit so fresh from a buffet before!!The Rivoli bar is worth a visit also! In a previous review of the ritz i mentioned that standards were slipping especially in terms of dress code and allowing people to wear trainers, jeans and sportswear. My opinion has not changed, the ritz is an experience and part of that experience is to get dressed up and adhere to the traditional standards, it would be nice to see this return.The staff are attentive and do the hotel proud! One particular male receptionist went above and beyond what was expected. He had arranged the upgrade and enquired about our plans for the evening. Our meal at the shard was booked for 10 and so he tried to arrange an earlier seating and ensure we got a good seat in the restaurant.

After breakfast, I went to settle the bil,and my wife went to the suite where the cleaner again came in to ask when we were leaving as she wanted to clean the room.

TheValients,110,73,First Class Experience,[5.0],"We were given a voucher for dinner at The Ritz by our very generous sister-in-law, so decided to make the most and book in for a night and breakfast too. The hotel really is the last word in discreet service of the highest order; our room (just the least expensive, cheap is not a word one could use in describing The Ritz!) was wonderful - comfy bed, Sky TV, great bathroom, etc. We were shown up to the room by the receptionist who checked us in and he showed us where everything was (hairdryer in drawer, did previous reviewers look there?) and arranged for complimentary tea to be brought up to the room. The dinner was very good too, though the table d'hote choice was a little limited; the breakfast was the best we have ever encountered.There were some small niggles; there were quite a few people dining with vouchers, and the system for dealing with this was, well, less than professional, especially as everyone had booked i.e. The Ritz knew who we all were and the details of our vouchers, so why keep guests waiting while those details were checked again? Our room overlooked Piccadilly and there was a bit of noise pollution as the outer window did not close properly, but we did manage to sleep without too many problems.Some of the other guests could do with reading the dress code before arriving - two chaps tried to dine dressed in T-shirts and we thought the Maitre d' was going to have a coronary; they were ushered out quickly and returned suitably attired! Another male guest though it was OK to lick his knife....repeatedly too. Ooops! All classic entertainment at no extra cost.

cucuruchito,357,197,"""The Concierge Experience""- A plus for wonderful Ritz London",[5.0],"At the Ritz you will feel you are travelling in time as soon as you reach the entrance on Arlington Street and very kind gentlemen with white gloves welcome you and help you with the luggage.Entering the lively atmosphere of the tea room or walking into the perfectly lit restaurant take you back in time to the comforts and sytle of a bygone era.  Live music serves as soft background, a quartet of strings and piano play tunes as people chat, dine or sip tea, and you know you ve stepped into a different world with its own sounds, flavours and codes.There are not many places where you can get such a plus. A trip in time. The spirit of past centuries is still there, trapped inside the grandour of the rooms, guarded by the wonderful drapes and curtains that frame the windows to Green Park.Everybody is expected to wear smart casual -never jeans or sneakers- and  jacket and tie is a rule for the restaurants. I think that more than blaming the Ritz for this, one should love it as it is... and follow the trend! This is one of the many reasons why it is different.It is an hotel with a strong identity and it s nice to preserve it and respect it. It s fun after all!The restaurant has recently refreshed its menu with a lighter, brighter options. Delicious lamb loin & artichoke and the egg duck was amazing. The breakfast buffet is something that has room for  improvente as the variety and arrangement looks small and plain in such a huge room. The efficient waiters bring everything you might need, and they offer cooked breakfast from the kitchen, but it s always nice to wake up to a great buffet. The Ritz breakfast would deserve it.This year we had the chance to stay at William Kent's building and  it s been wonderful.  Every room I ve seen at the hotel is beautiful. Recently, I've  noticed some rooms are being refurbished, for instance the Piccadilly Suite. It is a beautiful suite but this one looks more modern, more similar to others in many fine hotels in London. I hope the rest of the suites and rooms are kept in the same traditional style they have now. I wouldn t like that they  change much. I especially like the deluxe suites cozy & chic decorations,  the bathrooms may look vintage but are very well maintained  and combine perfectly with the rest of the suite. A Nespresso coffee maker would be a good thing to add to the each room.Always appreciated!We d like to thank the attention and care of the Manager on Duty who went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and comfortable,  also o William and Jacob who were always there for anything we might have needed, and of course we d like to thank the Concierges, especially Mike and Andy.There is no other place than The Ritz to enjoy the perfect concierge experience. Mike, Andy, Tony and their team are  trully professional concierges. They know exactly what to do and who to call in order to help you with what you need. They have worked at The Ritz for a very long time, I guess, so they  know the regular guests,  they remember their names and tastes, and we guests are glad and thankful for their attentive care and to find them there again every time we are lucky enough to enjoy a stay. Hotels have concierges but the Ritz have the real ones! We feel so lucky to have met such lovely people and to be able to choose the Rtiz when we are in London... mainly because it s different, because it is a trip in time and also because of the kindness and care we receive from all the people who work there. A caring atmosphere that combined with beauty and magic, is timeless and priceless.", February 2015, Travelled with family
Mike D,174,80,A Fabulous & Iconic Institution,[4.0],"Stayed twice in space of a couple of months. We couldn't fault the attentive service; the lobby team are quite amazing.The rooms are classic - as you'd expect - as are the bathrooms. We felt that there should be no excuse for outdated bathroom facilities at this level and cost. Also felt the maintenance of the bathrooms let down the rest of the hotel team's effort.The casino is small but fun, the bar is historic and fabulous, the breakfast service is poor and doesn't 'fit in' with the excellent service elsewhere on the same floor.I read that Mr Boxhall has been dismissed (resignation accepted etc) and that is a shame, he has a style and class that suited this hotel. So maybe now the brothers B will spend some of the money they are saving on the bathrooms.Would I stay again? No, not unless rooms fully refurbished.", November 2014, Travelled as a couple

We booked the 1 night Dinner and Dancing package. We arrived, found ourselves upgraded to a deluxe suite and escorted to the bar for complimentary champagne  as our room was not ready! The lovely receptionist later took us to our suite, oh so decadent it was. It's old-world loveliness. My teenage daughter, wishing to work in interiors, saw the photos later and said it needs to be renovated... No!!!! It's all English flowers, triple curtains, creams, yellow, blues, gilded mirrors and history. The only surprise is that there was no kettle! Room service brought one on request (it's an extra charge!) but hey, we are at the Ritz, who's being stingy?. Dinner was 4-course plus extra cake for us celebrating the anniversary. Most tables around us celebrated something. The dinner was one of the best we have had in London. Breakfast wonderful. Guests dress up and look beautiful throughout. If you want old English and the best service the capital can offer, it's here you find it.", November 2014,nan
BuriuDragos,111,50,Maybe just an unfortunate experience,[4.0],Came back to the Ritz after a few years as before I was staying at the Savoy which was not as central as I would have liked. I was not happy here that the room I was in the first time had a pipe going through the wall and when someone from upstairs took a shower you could hear the water flowing. I was woken up at 6:40 by someone who like early long showers. Then after I changed the room I was unfortunate enough to have a person in the next room that was having a Skype call at 1 AM. Only after 3 complains to the reception they were able to go to the person and ask him to respect the privacy of others. Now my guess is that the walls are too thin or something. I don't have a solution to recommended. Maybe I was just unlucky to have this kind of experience. Still it was the first time I had this kind of problem so I will not stay at The Ritz anymore. Now regarding the positive things I can say that the service is at its peak. Concierge and restaurant staff is flawless. They really make you feel special., February 2015,nan
Tracie H,161,58,Putting On The Ritz Package,[3.0],"I booked a surprise birthday stay at the Ritz for my husband.  Decided to opt for a deluxe King room.  On arriving we were shown to reception where we were offered an ""upgrade"" then four words were added "" for a small fee"".  We asked how much and were told £350!  This wasn't an upgrade this was a sell of a better room.  I was very embarrassed as it looked like I had opted for a basic room for our stay.  Never before have we had to pay for an upgrade and certainly never been offered it at the original price.Moving on to the afternoon tea, this was fantastic and the service first class, same with the breakfast.  100% pleased with the quality and quantity of the food.The room, it was pleasant with a large bathroom.  The shower had a very strong massage to it which was great.  When we got in late that night we realised that the bed had a blanket and no duvet.  It wasn't very nice and wasn't particularly warm.  We had had to turn the heating off as it came out of a very noisy unit in the bedroom.  There was also no hairdryer supplied.I'm sure we could have phoned down and requested a duvet and hairdryer but it was midnight and we were tired.I did fill in the questionnaire sent to me and suggested that on booking it would be a good idea to give people the choice of blanket or duvet and to let you know there is no hairdryer.  I also said how unhappy and embarrassed I was when we booked in.

All the staff look as if they are happy at what they do and do not differentiate between visiting guests. Combine this with beautiful guest rooms, public rooms and fabulous dining experiences , then it is no wonder that guests keep returning to The Ritz. From the moment we drove up ( in our Polo!!) we were treated so graciously that I was literally taken aback . I have been so used to lack luster service at other London 5 star establishments that I honestly began to believe that I was expecting too much!! Here, the guest is King ( or Queen) ! I could go on forever on how wonderful this hotel is , but whether one is staying or purely visiting for Afternoon Tea , it never fails to impress.

The hotel is a famous landmark and it does not lose touch with its past while still being modern in all the proper ways. It actually feels like you are staying in a museum but have everything a modern hotel should. My room was great. It was large and the the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was also quite spacious. The internet was very fast here as well and was free for guests. There is also access to the Ritz Club and Casino which are over the top great. The Ritz Cigar Room was also very nice and they had a great selection of various cigars from around the world. The staff also makes you feel special and valued. That is a great thing to have. I was even treated with a complimentary drive to the Royal Opera House one of the nights which was a classy touch. The doorman was quite friendly as well. After a night at the Ritz club I was very happy to see my bed adorned with rose petals in the shape of a heart.

We also said we didn't need newspapers for the morning but were given them anyway?! One area I was really disappointed in was the room service food. The menu wasn't very appealing, not much choice and we paid £26 each for a sandwich that wasn't even nice, the bread was toasted but had gone soggy and cold. The chicken was dry with no flavour and the ham and cheese tasted really cheap. The hot chocolate was also cold and undrinkable, we should of complained but after a busy day we were tired and just wanted to sleep.

Yes, it's expensive but, for a treat or special occasion, it really is worth it. One small niggle was that we couldn't get into our room until almost 3.30 and as we were being collected at 5.30 for dinner on the Orient Express (another fabulous experience), our preparations were a little rushed (well mine were at least!). We had arrived at 1.50 and were asked to wait ""10 or 15 minutes"" until the room was ready.

Aussietraveller1984,9,84,Magnificent hotel with attentive staff,[5.0],"It has taken me a while to review this hotel, but I feel that I should compliment the staff on making the Ritz one of the best hotels in London.I first stayed at the Ritz in January 2013 for four nights. Checking in was a seamless affair, with bags taken from my car and delivered to my room moments after I was taken up in one of the lifts.  From the moment you step inside, greeted by the welcoming doorman, there is a sense that the place is something truly special. It doesn't feel like a hotel, but more a private club. There are no bags in the lobby area (save the shopping bags accumulated on various outings around the city) and you never have to wait for concierge as the desk is well staffed and most knowledgable. I found I could ask almost anything and they'd have the answer within seconds. On my first stay I booked an Executive King Room, which was tastefully decorated in blue and gold - two of my favourite colours. The fittings were all very elegant and exactly what one would expect from a hotel fitted out in Louis XVI style. The room was immaculate and large - it had two wardrobe areas which stored plenty of luggage/clothes and a very large electronic safe (which is very welcome compared to the small ones often found even in luxury hotels). The room had black out blinds that meant no light came in whatsoever for a great night's sleep. The bathroom was one of the best I have had in a hotel, from its elegant gold plated sink fixtures, to heated towel racks and excellent shower pressure.Despite appearances to the contrary, the bed was very comfortable. This proved a problem as I quite enjoyed sleeping in, despite wanting to go out and do things during my London stay! My only criticism of the hotel would have to be the breakfast. While I did enjoy the Downton Abbey style arrangement with three well dressed attendants in close proximity, the food was somewhat disappointing. I have found that scrambled eggs, and eggs generally, are done poorly in the top hotels of Europe and the UK when compared to Australia. Good scrambled eggs are meant to be fluffy rather than sloppy. When ordering mushrooms, I had expected small sauteed mushrooms but received one large one. Despite having pre booked breakfast for four days, I decided to eat out for the rest of the stay.On my subsequent visit in June 2014 I decided not to eat breakfast at the hotel fearing a repeat of the year before. Unfortunately, I was only able to stay at the hotel for two non consecutive nights due to travel plans that took me back and forth across the continent. Not wanting to take all my luggage between the visits, the concierge happily organised to store suitcases for the second night of my two night stay. I think they must have cleaned them as I noticed a scuff mark previously on one bag had been removed - very thoughtful! What I was most impressed with was the fact that after more than a year between stays, I was greeted at the front desk as a return guest - it's always nice to have a little personalisation. I'm nobody special, but staff always smiled and greeted me as though I was somebody important. However, it is the concierge staff who have impressed me most on my visits: their ability to remember names and room numbers when guests return from a day outside is remarkable. I think there was only one time when I was asked for my room number - every other time I was welcomed back and simply handed the correct key! I'd booked a Deluxe King room for each of my nights on this trip. On the first of the non consecutive nights, I was upgraded to a Junior suite. The Junior suite was quite impressive, not least because of the size! It was very nice to just relax after a 24 hour flight from Australia, despite sleeping on the plane. Even with a mattress lining the flat bed, an airline seat cannot compare to a plush king bed. On this trip I decided to use the front desk to book two car services on account of my regular car company not having any luxury vehicles available. Sadly, I needed to check out after the first night at an ungodly time of 4am! Still, the front desk arranged my small cases I was taking with me to be taken down to the car. By the time I was ready, I was wished a good journey by the concierge staff and informed my car was waiting. Having booked a regular town car, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Ritz Jaguar waiting to take me to Heathrow. I was certainly spoiled! It was the smoothest ride imaginable and I was very sorry to have to get out for my short flight to Germany. The second car for my trip to Gatwick wasn't the Jaguar, but it was exactly what I wanted and everything was perfectly in order for that service too. My second night on returning from Germany was in the Deluxe room I had paid for - while smaller than a suite, it was still beautiful. Despite being a corner room overlooking the main street, I couldn't hear any noise from outside. This was certainly appreciated as I like total silence to sleep. Really, the Ritz is my favourite hotel. It is beautiful, historic, and the staff are absolutely professional. The internet/wifi is also free - a very big plus given many 5 star hotels still charge for this basic service. While I get that some people might find such a hotel intimidating, I think you just have to enjoy everything it has to offer. I plan on trying out services I have not used on my next visit at the end of this year. Given the positive reviews, I am tempted to try afternoon tea. Counting down the days!", June 2014, Travelled solo

pgpbro,36,48,Apparently just for the rich among us,[3.0],"Okay, once in my life I wanted to stay at the World Famous Ritz in London.  It was just a bucket list thing to do.  But, if I were to be honest, would I ever come back?  No.  Not because of the service, which was par excellence.  What room you get for your money is just almost ludicrous.  I paid 800 pounds per night (approx. $1,200 U.S. dollars).  It was a splurge, of course.  But I didn't expect that the room would be slightly larger than a closet.  They were quick to tell me that I could upgrade for only another 1,100 pounds (per night), the equivalent of approximately $1,600 more per night based on currency conversion.  So, to get a ""decent"" room, I would need to spend almost $3,000 per night.  Again, I understand some properties are just for the rich and famous, and to keep the riff and raff apparently like me out.  But for my $1,200 per night, I would have at least expected a great room, to go along with the reputation.  Also, I arrived on Christmas Day, and inquired (a few weeks earlier) about having Christmas Dinner at the hotel.  I was informed that I would have to prepay with a credit card, and that it would be the equivalent of U.S. $1,000 (for my wife and myself).  My problem with this is in the value they are purporting to provide.  You are not paying for the food, or the room.  You are only paying for their name.  I went elsewhere for Christmas dinner, and only stayed five nights of my two week stay in London.", December 2014, Travelled as a couple

At no point did I feel they went the extra mile or something was surprisingly exceptional. I also felt that they were kind of in a way looking down on us the whole time we were there. Now we're two 18 year olds, I imagine they don't have a fair amount of couples our age checking in but none the less I just felt out of place here.  If your planning on staying here for a special occasion you'll have an amazing time and will 100% enjoy it. But don't expect more than the stereotype around the ritz group.

If I deduct what it would have cost me had I gone out to a Michelin star restaurant, the room was only the cost of 3 nights at a 3 star hotel, or twice the cost of the very praiseworthy Rubens hotel near Buckingham Palace.So treat yourself – go there !", December 2014, Travelled as a couple

858Someone,7,78,"Stunning building, but dismal and unfriendly service",[1.0],"My girlfriend and I stayed at The Ritz for a night between Christmas and New Year to do a bit of shopping and catch up with friends. We both live in Hong Kong, but used to live in London. I haven't stayed at The Ritz before and would usually opt for a boutique hotel in London, however I thought it would be nice to try it.The building is absolutely stunning and worth a visit. Afternoon tea is something I have done before and enjoyed thoroughly. Staying there, however, you are exposed to the fact that the service is absolutely appalling. A healthy blend between people being inept and rude. I must stress that this does not relate to all of the staff, I wish I could excuse some from this overwhelmingly poor review and few individuals were great.Best I list a few incidents that stood out for me.1 We were checked into the wrong room, and waited 20 minutes for them to bring a key for the correct room which never came, so we just went out.2 They couldn't find our bags when we arrived or left, each time taking 10 - 15 minutes to locate - 50:50 time split between ignoring us and failing to locate them.3 The staff in the Rivoli Bar give you the hacky teenage girl up and down look when you walk in. They then actually were very obviously gossiping about us throughout our entire tenure in the bar. An eastern European waitress who 'welcomed' us in and one of the waiters seemed to be the main culprits. It was quite entraordinary - we were trying to convince ourselves that we were mistaken but it was difficult to enjoy ourselves in those circumstances.4 We went back to collect our bags after we had checked out and been shopping for an hour or some reason, when I didn't apparently make it clear enough that we were picking up our bags he said 'WHAT!' and stared at me until I looked away. We left the hotel, asking ourselves whether that really happened.5 Typically, when you would like to speak to someone around the concierge / reception area you have to wait until they finish talking amongst themselves until you have earned some service.My negative preconceptions would be that the old money customers who hve been going there for 20 years would have been looked after, which they were and rightly so. Then that, the future of the business was aimed at an emerging market consumer, who may be too overwhelmed with the stunning building to notice how poor the service was and opt to pay a premium for this - maybe repeat customers are no longer important. I must stress that this is not a comment directed at all of the staff. The common denominator throughout however, was that we were unwelcome and shouldn't be there.Needless to say, I do not recommend The Ritz. I must say, that this is all solveable (i'm not looking for a freebie, I would have no intention of returning) - amazing looking hotel, with history and prestige. The food (apart from tea at The Ritz) is very standard but it could be improved. My feeling however, is that there must be something wrong further up the chain in the hotel for it to be this widespread and there needs to be a fundamental acknowledgement from the people who work there, that they are there for the customer who have already committed to staying at the hotel.", December 2014, Travelled as a couple

We booked in on Christmas eve for three nights and got back home today after the most amazing christmas I can remember bookedback in February  after a nightmare christmas 2013 and thinking after 30 years looking after others at christmas it is now time for me to go somewhere else for christmas but where ? After discussing it with my partner we looked online and I came across pictures of christmas 2013 at the ritz , perfect  exactly as I like my own home to be , red gold and full of swags and cheer. It was only after I booked it that I read some of the reviews on here and began to get worried. Would we ""fit in"" and what about these ""snooty staff"" ? I really need not have worried at all .From the moment we arrived everything was wonderful and everynone was friendly and helped with everything that we needed. Breakfast was delicious as was the afternoon tea on christmas day and the dinner in the evening. It was so perfect that I thought that something must go wrong somewhere , it did not go wrong only got better and better. The decor is beautiful and I even discovered not one but two busts of Marie Antoinette in the hotel , she is a favourite historical person of mine , another reason I chose this hotel. This trip was  what I believe would be called a considered purchase and was it worth it , you bet. I feel as though my three nights here have been as relaxing as a two week stay elsewhere and would I bother with another hotel probably not. I get the feeling that the staff here are quite rightly proud to be part of such a wonderful establishment. I could go on and on and probably will in private company till I bore people to death. Room beautiful , surroundings beautiful ,food wonderful and overall complete value for money I would say. Finally as for some of the negative comments here on tripadvisor I think that these people must have stayed somewhere else.

Our children settled in and really enjoyed themselves which seriously enhanced our stay too. The Christmas decorations were superb, especially the huge tree.We booked a junior suite but at reception were offered an amazing deal to upgrade as the hotel needed more standard rooms. The hotel had a signature deluxe suite unsold for the night so we took it. It was well worth the extra few pennies! The suite was a one bedroom apartment with amazing views over Green Park and Piccadilly. The suite was immaculate and massive. My kids loved exploring it. The lounge, which was converted into their bedroom at turndown, was packed with kiddies goodies, including DVDs, Wii, teddy bears, kiddie drinks and snacks etc... They were also given membership to the Kidz at the Ritz club enabling them to have complimentary ice cream during their stay. We were given an invitation to visit the Fine Jewellery boutique with free champagne. After our night out we popped to the Rivoli bar with the kids and while they had ice cream, we indulged into the cocktail menu. The bathroom was also amazing.

ThorpeT,117,75,Perfection,[5.0],"I've always loved the Ritz for its decor, but our recent stay was so good that I have been puzzling how to analyse this objectively for tripadvisor people.There are certain givens for a grand hotel: everything works, the place looks good, the food is to a high standard. But now that the Savoy has fallen off a cliff, the Ritz is without doubt the finest hotel in London, an absolute must for the traveller looking for the best.Why?Well I think it's their staff. There was a pervasive feel of highly trained and polished professionalism, an unforced friendliness and natural politeness - tremendously impressive when sustained throughout a very large and busy building.Old hands will remember the late great Giles Shepard, hotelier to the stars. I like to think this astonishing perfection is his lasting legacy.", December 2014, Travelled with family

We visited in December and the Christmas tree and decorations were gorgeous. The tea itself consisted of sandwiches with 6 fillings, and the staff kept refilling these as the plate emptied. The smoked salmon was amazing. Following this, warm scones were brought out with clotted cream and jam, also very tasty but not as crumbly as a normal scone. The cakes were nice to look at but not to my personal taste (coffee macaroon). Nonetheless I would rate it 5 stars, because of the attention to detail, surroundings, attentive staff and nice food.

Pearl_30years,134,32,The perfect celebration venue.,[5.0],"Afternoon tea at the Ritz is one very special experience.  Taken for my 65th birthday on 4th December by my son, it was a surreal experience from the moment we walked through the polished brass doors, welcomed by the immaculate doorman and assisted throughout by every member of staff on duty.  Nothing was too much trouble.The dress code was clearly outlined when booking (it was essential to book many months before our intended visit to ensure a table).  Everyone was clearly turned out in style to ensure being a part of a very English experience.The foyer of The Ritz was tastefully decorated in typical seasonal style with the most beautiful red and gold Christmas decorations and an enormous Christmas tree that extended right up into the domed roof space.  This theme continued throughout the Palm Court and into the restaurant.We took afternoon tea in the Palm Court Restaurant having been shown to our table positioned right in the centre of the dining room.  We were invited to select teas from a variety of specialities and then the immaculate waiter brought a two tier cake stand full of the most deliciously filled sandwiches in white and brown bread.  This was followed by an assortment of delicious scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream contained in the most beautiful matching lidded china.  All the tableware was in matching blue and white English china and presented on solid silver platters with solid silver teapots, hot water jugs and milk/cream jugs.  On the top tier of cake stand was an assortment of the most delicious fancy cakes.The experience was relaxed and thoroughly enjoyable.  Each booking/sitting is for two hours at a time and this provided us with plenty of time to sit back and take in the ambience of the occasion.  The addition of the pianist in the Palm Court completed the atmosphere perfectly.Following our tea, came the trolley with two different gateaux of choice – we could not fault the quantity of food, in fact there was too much for us and we did, regretfully, have to leave one or two of the fancy cakes.My son had ordered champagne to enhance the occasion and this was brought to the table after we had eaten together with a most unexpected  surprise in the form of a birthday cake with a lit candle, whilst the pianist played “happy birthday”.We were in no rush to leave and indeed had plenty of time to spend in the Ritz afterwards. Even the waiters were happy to oblige with photography and we came away with an array of wonderful photographs to enhance the memory of our day.   The Ritz offers several levels of afternoon tea at different prices and I believe that what we received was their “celebration tea with champagne” – everything was perfect; the food, the service, the atmosphere was something that will remain with me for a very long time to come.", December 2014, Travelled with family
David S,433,95,A few small issues but overall marvelous,[5.0],"My wife and I stayed in a very nice suite at the Ritz from December 9th thru December 11th 2014. The room itself was spectacularly furnished and absolutely gorgeous! There were however a few small issues with what I call ""infrastructure"". The drapes were shedding some of their protective coating against the sun, and there was no hair dryer. They did provide us with one but the plug did not fit the only plug available in the bathroom. To complicate matters, when my wife went to use it, the surgeon electricity kept tripping the circuit breaker. Other than that annoying little feature the room itself was one of the best we have ever stayed in.Room service, although very expensive, was efficient and the food was delicious. All of the staff were very friendly and very efficient especially the doormen.Usually when we visit London, we stay at The Lanesborough, but since it was closed we chose the Ritz this time. In the future we will consider the Ritz again as we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.", December 2014, Travelled as a couple

Happy to take photos to enhance our experience.The lovely finger sandwiches did not disappoint and were endless in supply but the cakes oh! absolutely amazing, we could not eat them all, it's impossible but we did give it a go.

Vivienne F,102,35,"Afternoon Tea at The Ritz, London - Fantastic",[5.0],"My friend & I stayed for 2 nights in a Junior Suite.  It lived up to the expectations as we stepped back in time, if only for two nights.Do take the opportunity in 'dressing well' for your Ritz experience.On the Friday at 17:30 we were booked in for the Afternoon Tea, which we enjoyed immensely and again the experience lived up to expectations. Afterwards, and on the Saturday too, we would have loved to have been able to sit and enjoy listening to the pianist; music and singers in the comfortable chairs nearby, but unfortunately all were 'Reserved', yet no-one was sat there.  On Sunday as we returned to collect our luggage for our onward journey, we chatted to one member of your Concierge team about this, who advised us that if we had mentioned it we would have been able to sit there as we were guests of the hotel.  Unfortunately this being our first time, we were unaware of this.  I completely understand why there is a need to do this, but for new guests, how are they supposed to know?It is the attention to detail that 'makes the difference' and The Ritz staff does this extremely well.  Every member of The Ritz staff that we came into contact with were immaculately turned out, polite and friendly, and it is because of these qualities that The Ritz is an experience and the legacy will live on.", December 2014, Travelled with friends
jock16,254,167,open to rich and poor alike,[4.0],"Originally applied to the law it is certainly true that when one one leaves this hotel one will be at least financially poorer. it was therefore somewhat annoying to be told our room was not ready at 3.55pm which was within 5 minutes of our estimated time of arrival sent to the hotel in response to their email requesting this. We were then led along the long gallery to find somewhere to sit while we waited, only to be taken pied piper-like back down again when none was available. I suppose it gave us the chance to admire the lavish  Christmas decorations in a hotel where everything if it is not swagged is gilded. Our room, one of the standard ones, was larger than its Savoy equivalent though the bathroom was smaller. Asprey toiletries.Soft pillows and comfortable large bed. Though overlooking Piccadilly sound proofing was excellent and little noise intruded. The room however failed my wife's mirror test inasmuch as there was none in the bedroom conveniently placed where she could sit and apply make up. She made her usual remark about the room being designed by a man.Wide choice at breakfast and my wife declared the scrambled eggs to be the best she had ever had. My bacon on the first day was overcooked and on the second I was brought a pot of cold coffee by mistake:but it passed the hot toast test.   So far as service was concerned that received from the reception, concierge and chambermaid was excellent. We were less impressed by other staff. In the bar we were asked twice by each of two waiters  whether we were enjoying our drinks one of whom simply butted in in the middle of our conversation. That is not attentive but intrusive service. Service at breakfast suffered to a lesser extent from the same problem and was bustling rather than discreet. Staff seem to have been trained to wish each guest good morning  and given the high staff to guest ratio it all got rather tiresome by the time we reached the dining room from our bedroom. Even as we left after breakfast two staff positioned one at either side of the entrance  simultaneously hoped we would have a pleasant day.At our previous stays at the Savoy and Claridges service tended to be rather more unobtrusive and to my mind this works better, though I appreciate this is a matter of personal preference.

judyandnick,12,3,THE VERY BEST HOTEL IN LONDON !,[5.0],"The title of my review says it all.  My husband and I have stayed at most of the top hotels in London including the  Savoy, Berkeley, Mandarin Oriental, The Dorchester etc and decided for many years that The Dorchester ticked most of our boxes so stayed there.  After so long we fancied a change so decided to stay at the Ritz for a 3 day break and are we so glad that we did.  It is truly a wonderful place and the staff are superb.  Having worked in 'the trade' at Director level I can tend to be nit-picky about certain aspects of hotel and catering but could not really, and nor did I wish to, find fault with the hotel.  So as not to repeat the many reviews extolling the virtues of the place there were two points that we did need to raise.   Small points but worth a note to anyone planning on a stay.  We booked a table at the Ritz Club on our first evening by email before our visit and on check in asked that this be confirmed, which it was by the receptionist phoning the Club, however when we went in to the Restaurant in the evening the female at the restaurant desk said that we were not booked in and they were full.  Not a great start.  I said that we had booked and also had double checked the booking but she was insistent we were not in the book and went as far to show us the page where we were indeed missing from the list.  She said that even if she did have a table we would have a long wait.  I asked how long and she said 20 minutes which to us is acceptable so asked if she would try to fit us in, which she did.  Now errors do occur in any business but unfortunately the woman seemed very harassed and passed it on to us in her attitude but I must also add that we did have a very enjoyable evening.  The food was superb albeit a little slow in arriving and we would eat there again.  The other point was when going for drinks in the Rivoli Bar on our second evening we were told they were full, there was no standing at the bar and we were to stand in a waiting area near the Palm Court.  This was our Wedding Anniversary night which we explained to the chap at the desk but he insisted there was no room. To me this is not on as we were resident and felt some tables should be kept for residents and also taking into account that in the bar we saw that people were in jeans, some with rucksacks, anoraks etc.  The time was 6.30 in the evening so the dress code should have been adhered to by the staff and not just accepting any passing tourist from the street. That said the bar manager apologised, found us a table and gave us 2 cocktails on the house to celebrate our anniversary.  Also he told us to book a table to be sure of a seat if we wished to have a drink the following evening which we did, and a table was duly reserved for us.  These are  minor points on the scale of things, although on those two evenings our excitement about the evening ahead was somewhat dampened by the booking error and the lack of 'rules of the house'.So moving on from this negative seam, everything else and I mean everything else was absolutely superb, top notch, the VERY best so do not hesitate in booking and we will most definitely return.", November 2014, Travelled as a couple

We could have been in a vast chateau in the heart of deepest France. We ordered a starter and main course.

Booking is essential and I believe there is a wait for places. Dress code applies.Afternoon tea consists of a choice of tea from a large selection and a variety of sandwiches and cakes. The Christmas Tea included a glass of Champagne and carol singers.  For children a Ritz teddy was given in place of the Champagne.  As you would expect the service was first class and the food delicious.  There was more than enough food.  This was a lovely evening in a stunningly beautiful hotel.  I cannot fault the evening in any way.Cost for Christmas afternoon tea was £68 per adult & £47 per child. This includes service charge and all taxes.  Yes it is expensive but for a special treat it is well worth the money., November 2014, Travelled as a couple
SuperDonkey,21,8,Pure Class,[5.0],"We stayed at the Ritz last Saturday night. We arrived at noon to be told the room would be ready at 2pm so we headed for the Rivoli bar for a couple of cocktails. The decor of the Rivoli bar is art-deco and simply stunning. The service was excellent and the cocktails, whilst not cheap, we're simply Devine. We had afternoon booked for 1.30 so headed to the palm court restaurant. The tea, sandwiches, scones, cakes & service were magnificent. I highly recommend coming to the Ritz for afternoon tea - it's an experience you must have. After finishing tea we went to check in to be told that we had been upgraded to the Trafalgar suite!! The suite is massive overlooking Green Park - absolutely magnificent. We were told that they had filmed some scenes from Nottingham Hill in the suite. We headed down for dinner to the Ritz restaurant, again the decor is absolutely stunning, there can't be another more beautiful setting in London to have dinner. We had a four course set menu, but could swap a dish or two for a small supplement. The food was excellent and you must try the soufflé desert - gorgeous. A live band played whilst we ate and we were also entertained by two professional dancers who were simply brilliant. Breakfast the next morning was excellent. The buffet choices were varied and very health conscious. I had the classic breakfast too - enough food to set you up for the rest of the day. The Xmas decorations really give the hotel a special feel to it. Finally, I must mention the staff who all couldn't do enough for us and make our stay at the Ritz very special - thank you, we will be back.", November 2014, Travelled as a couple

Paul J,21,17,"""The Ritz is a Cracker!""",[5.0],"It all began back in March when two close friends bought my wife a voucher for afternoon tea at the RItz. She asked me to accompany her and we duly booked for Monday 3 November.Somehow this developed into a stay at the RItz and a show to boot! My wife found the ""Simply Sunday Package"" the hotel offers which includes dinner; an executive king; champagne and flowers in the room and breakfast. The 5pm show at the Piccadilly Theatre, ""Jersey Boys"" fitted perfectly with our 8.30pm dinner booking. Wow, what a show - truly superb.Getting the enjoyable walk through Green Park and visit to Fortnum & Mason out of the way, let's move on to the Ritz. From the moment a bell boy removed our suitcase from the taxi after we affirmed we were staying that evening to making the return trip to the station, the whole experience was a 10/10.Check-in was easy and a tour of the ground floor was offered and gratefully accepted. Our first floor room was delightful with every amenity imaginable - if this is an executive king, what on earth are the suites like?! Real flowers adorn your surroundings every few yards; the dining room is magnificent to the extent that you almost forget why you're there; the tea room tops even that and the whole place has this regal elegance you expect but are still surprised by.The food is exquisite and the waiters are so slick, in pairs systematically removing the dome covers from your food on it's arrival. The bar is obviously expensive but a brandy for me and a cocktail for my wife after dinner just had to be done - after all, we had ""swerved"" the casino! The concierge desk staff cannot do enough for you, opening doors to let you through before you make a conscious decision to move that way and the east end doorman provided the humour I so enjoy.I guess what really impressed us was the fact that, despite being in the ""cheap seats"" so to speak, at no time did the staff make us feel any less important than every other guest and they are to be congratulated for that.We couldn't really have imagined that a stay at the RItz was for us but, the way the whole experience makes you feel  has you with one simple thought - we have to do THAT again!!", November 2014, Travelled as a couple
Stefanovic,38,33,First Class,[5.0],"As a frequent visitor to London , this is my favourite hotel and this way my fourth visit. I would say the price is competetive for a 5 star hotel, great location and attentive, professional staff all the way.Everyone is polite, expert at their job and the hotel oozes class. The Ritz club for guests is worth a visit, smart casino and very relaxing bar area. The dining room is amazing, wonderful frescoes and Lavishly decorated, just like stepping back in time. If you like Downton Abbey, you'll like the Ritz.Food is excellent, breakfast had everything you could wish for. I brought seven guests with me for a meeting too and they were all very impressed.We are already planning our next visit, I honestly cannot find fault with the place.", November 2014, Travelled on business
Ann G,20,9,All that Glitters is Gold and it is the Ritz Hotel,[5.0],"In these days of minimalism and spartan urban decor it is such a panacea to step into this glorious fairy-tale palace of gilt and pretty paintwork & murals.The formal dining room makes one feel cosseted especially if the 40's style singer and musicians are in situ (- Friday Nights??).My date had requested a gluten-free meal for me ahead of the booking and the staff were so helpful about this that I ate more than I would normally because I generally pass on bread, desserts etc!It is a MUST place to eat at least once in a lifetime.

Smitherino,86,48,"Average room, amazing breakfast, laughable gym!",[3.0],"I remember being so excited as a kid to even drive past the Ritz. It had a history and reputation as the best hotel in London. Unfortunately, aside from a few modern day essentials such as TV and phones I think it's mostly the same stuff that was there many years back. The room is a good size by London standards, but it has two beds pushed together to make one, the furnishings are old (but not in a classy way), the bathroom is awful with a pathetic shower over the bath and sporting a suite that must be twenty plus years old. I had breakfast in the grand salon room which is an incredible room and looks like something you'd find in Buckingham Palace. The price at £36 was excessive but I can forgive them this due to great selection and first class service. I have finally to mention the gym which was basically a box room on the 7th floor converted to a gym. It had hardly any equipment or space so as a result was crowded with only two people in there. I loved the hotel history, lobby and common areas plus location is great but this place needs some loving and updating.", November 2014, Travelled on business
luke393,71,36,An old lady.,[3.0],"The Ritz is indeed an iconic old hotel of London, bearing the famous name of the founder of modern hotels. It is Located in the heart of London, conveniently located at the Green Park subway station (hence direct line from St Pancras station). The entrance hall is very nice, with pleasant doormen. The tea room is nice and obviously crowded everyday. Bear in mind that they apply there, and in the restaurant (for lunch and dinner) a strict dress code for men: jacket is required. A less formal attire is ok for breakfast. The elevator just in front of the High Tea room reflects a very bad taste with paintings of a very kitsch style, quite astonishing for such a hotel! The rooms are of limited size (5th floor) with Louis XVI style painted furnitures. Nothing increadible actually. Bathroom is fine, with a bathtub where shower can be of course taken. (no separate bath and shower though). I had to notice that the use of hair dryer in the room is hardly possible in front of a mirror! This kind of details is very important, and has obviously been forgotten! To be noticed that the quality of bed is below average, it is so soft that when sitting on the bed, one ends ""deep in the bed""!. Friendly employees. The breakfast room during week end is very busy, significantly deteriorating the level of service for a hotel of this type. Buffet is ok, however with no extraordinary food for this kind of hotel. All in all, could do better. Also, as the hotel is on Picadilly, there can be some noise from the street.", November 2014, Travelled solo
WillieVancouver,102,87,Excellent 5 Star hotel,[5.0],"A beautiful, iconic old hotel, meticulously maintained and offering true 5 star service from highly trained staff. If you have stayed at the independently owned Ritz Paris (before the renovation closure) you will immediately feel at home with the decor and professional service.Check-in takes place in a small anti chamber off the main lobby while your baggage is being whisked to your room. Our room was one step up from standard and was very maintained, well equipped and well decorated. It was not large but was perfectly adequate. It was very quiet at all times.We had afternoon tea in the Palm Court, it was very good and the ambiance was all that we expected - and our expectations were fairly high.Dinner in the Ritz Restaurant was very good. The room is palatial, the service was attentive without being intrusive, and the food was excellent.One of the highlights of of our stay was gaining complimentary access to The Ritz Club via the glass mirror ""secret door"".   What a magnificent facility!  The Ritz Club Restaurant, the bar and the casino areas are not particularly large but the ambiance is wonderful. Think in terms of an ""over-the-top"" Edwardian palace. If you haven't seen the photographs of this club on The Ritz website, you really should look at them. The pictures, as beautiful as they are, still don't do it full justice.The Ritz Club Restaurant is slightly less formal than The Ritz Restaurant, but, IMHO, is even more elegant. I suggest that no stay at this hotel is complete without using this restaurant and the other fine services in the club.A second highlight was the terrific late night service we received at the Rivoli Bar. We arrived very near their closing time (on Oct. 6th?) and the bar was empty. Instead of being turned away we were warmly greeted by the two young men on duty. (Franco and another equally pleasant gentleman whose name I can't remember)They were under a government mandated time limit for serving alcohol but assured us that we would not need to rush and could finish our drinks in a leisurely manner. Not only did they not rush us, when I initiated a conversation with them they responded enthusiastically and went out of their way to tell us about some of the history of the bar.My wife was delighted to hear about their Louboutin  glass slipper, for drinking their special champagne cocktails of course (lol). They also showed us a magnificent vodka set consisting of a large golden (Faberge style) egg, which opens up to display a beautiful decanter and several shot glasses. All very interesting stuff.These staff members are a credit to the hotel. At a time of night when many bar operators are in a hurry to go home, these two gentlemen allowed us to engage them in some friendly banter and made us feel very welcome - almost part of the family. Remarkable service, but I guess that's The Ritz.Bottom line: we have stayed in plenty of 5 star hotels in Europe, Asia and North America, but this was one of the very best hotel experiences we have ever had. We are enthusiastically looking forward to our next stay at The Ritz.", October 2014, Travelled as a couple

Nannah M,18,14,A BIT OF A LET DOWN,[3.0],"Where oh where was the sophistication and glamour of the ritz of yesterday. I think a little of it was lost in the translation of modern living. Ok, me and my wheelchair and yes you are correct, my 2 young discernining grandsons did our tour of duty. This time to the wonderful Ritz hotel to live the life if only for a couple of nights. I am a little long in the tooth and yes I agree that changing times must create movement across all spheres of life. Thing is, do we have to eradicate elegance in order to appreciate modernism? I think not. So here I am with my poor shallow pockets saving to introduce my loved ones to the elegance and finery that I once enjoyed in the very salubrious surroundings of what was once described as the best hotel in the world. I booked the dinner and dance option, we donned cummerbund, bow ties, cravats, ball gowns and cocktail dresses, pretentious you might say but to us we just wanted a little piece of old world charm and as the name suggests, Ritz. We booked the dinner dance package and really tried hard to look the part. With anticipation we prepared to join in the pomp of all that is fine, looking forward to waltzes, tangos etc. shock, horror, embarrassment. The best dressed persons around were the waiting/serving staff, they looked marvellous in their bow ties and tails. We stood out like sore thumbs, or at best looked as though we were going to a fancy dress event, not wishing to cast any aspersions but nowhere could we see the dinner suits and gowns we expected. That was a huge let down, however, some did take to the dance floor and seem to have enjoyed the moment.On the matter of our surrounding the glamour and old world charm of the hotel did not disappoint. The air of excitement and expectancy of the approaching festive season was completely missing but as we were still at the start of November there is time to pull something out of the hat. Rooms were beautifully adorned and the bed certainly cuddled me to sleep; service was brisk and with a smile.Throughout the hotel, service and serving staff were lovely, polite and helpful but for us, sadly the menu was not as expected or hoped for. We were offered the very same sparse and unimaginative menu for lunch and dinner apparently because we were on a 'package' whatever that means. We later discovered there was an alternative a la carte menu but was never offered it as a choice. All things considered that might have been because we were seen as the poor cousins, we certainly felt that way. Having dined at the Ritz on previous occasion I can honestly say there was no comparison. I wanted my family to have the same taste journey I have experienced but they left feeling there wasn't even a 3* menu on offer. To cap it all, there were mistakes with my final account. Firstly, after paying the bulk of our invoice we found not only was it duplicated we were also being billed for services delivered to another guest. Secondly, not wanting to linger on our last morning, I cleared our table account but again that bill was duplicated. I did indeed make known my concerns and although some attempt was made to explain what went wrong I am non the wiser, is it sorted or is it not? I am yet to find out. To add insult to injury, I received a call from the food and beverage manager, he was very polite but did little to win back my confidence perhaps our sort is not to be encouraged. His main concern it seems was to inform me they had done their best and whilst some things might have gone wrong there were too many of us to compensate. However, he went on to say if we booked a meal (I suggested afternoon tea) perhaps they could throw in a couple bottles of champagne. That on reflection was ungracious and a little insulting, I can and do purchase my own champagne but I think there should have been a definite invite (wether discounted or not) to return with my entire party to sample what the Ritz has to offer. I am certain like all hotels there are low season tariffs and given it was a special occasion that turned out not to be very special, I believe they missed something. That to me is not the way to rectify a mistake and encourage custom, I love the decadence of the past and being an older person look forward to my annual or bi-annual posh hotel trips. Will I return to the Ritz? sadly, I don't think so. That was of a bygone era which it appears has gone for good. The Ritz was once a great place and I am certain it still is but on this occasion we were very badly let down. To the management I would say, remember not everyone is steeped in £. Some of us have to save for such extravagance but we are no less worthy than the dripping wealthy, nor are we less deserving of your best service. When it comes to the £, we are paying the same and we probably have greater respect for your efforts. If something is amiss, don't be too mean in your offer to put it right as its all part of the reputation you seek to cultivate.", November 2014, Travelled with family

Cornishdish,73,20,If only....,[4.0],My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the Ritz (5 & 6 Nov) as a treat before flying out to New York (even bigger treat). The hotel is very impressive and staff are friendly. We had cocktails and a meal in the beautiful Rivoli bar and although the food was good it was quite expensive but that was only to be expected. The room was really nice and I must admit the bedding was superb with lovely duck down pillows. I admit here I usually take my own feather pillow everywhere with me (even to 5* hotels) but as we were off to New York I reluctantly left it at home so you can imagine my relief to discover a pillow better than mine. NOW TO THE IF ONLY..... After a 5 hour drive to the Hotel we were gasping for a cup of tea and to our dismay we found the hotel room did not have any tea making facilities! We had to order a pot of tea which cost £19 and considering we normally drink a lot of tea including in the middle of the night sometimes we were horrified. The Ritz did email requesting feedback and I told them we would not have stayed there had we known and I had a nice reply offering A complementary tray on our next visit but that really isn't enough so I although it was a good hotel we will not be going there again. * Just a note to say when we arrived in New York we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria and as we booked in I asked about tea making facilities and was again told they were not normally supplied unless asked for.

The room was disappointing on this occasion but perhaps that was the consequence of my partner booking it through Expedia? I always book direct. There were no upgrades available.The one other noticeable difference on this occasion was that no member of staff called me by my name, something in my other reviews I have always commented on.

Elma40,20,37,Happy to take the money...,[2.0],"It is not often that I am drawn to complain about a stay in a hotel and in particular, one with the apparent reputation of The Ritz.I had booked a single night's stay for 13/14th November to assess the ambience and suitability for two upcoming events: a small (10 or so) group booking for a fiftieth birthday party in March, and a larger dinner event for a group of senior scientists, innovators and government employees in October (including a proportion to be accommodated at a hotel by my host organisation).I was extremely disappointed. A litany of small but irritating issues which I would not expect from a Hotel such as the Ritz. Staff on arrival who could not get my name right. Constantly referring to me as Mr, not Dr. A relatively trivial problem but grating after the second or third time reminding them. On arrival in my room I found no ironing board and iron, despite making a specific request. First phone call to reception. Only one power socket. I understand that this is an old hotel, but? Second phone call to reception for an extension lead. Heating/cooling not working. Third phone call to reception. By this point I just resigned myself to any other problems and gave up ringing. The next set of issues included the curtain pull not working. The television remote batteries were flat (lucky I had some with me), the turn down service arrived at 6.30 when I was in the shower - despite having been booked at 8.00 p.m. when I knew that I would be out. The shower itself was very problematic, varying between scalding water and very cold (so bad that I didn't shower the next morning - thankfully the Dorchester, my next port of call this morning was very accommodating and allowed me to book into a room early to shower before meetings when I explained the problems at the Ritz). The sink in the bathroom was partially blocked. And so it went on. The wifi endeavoured to levy a charge despite my booking clearly showing that this was included in the room charge. A mattress so saggy and worn that I wondered if it was a contemporary of César Ritz himself. The whole experience was not something I expect. It is the first hotel I have stayed in for more that ten years without any complimentary mineral water for example. Fair enough, no complimentary tea or coffee given the reputation for the restaurant, but water?But the worst problem of all was the overriding feeling that there are quite clearly two classes of customer - those with clear wealth or fame, and those that the staff feel are less 'well heeled' for a variety of indistinct reasons. I really was not made to feel welcome (when compared with around 100 hotels that I've stayed in across the planet in the last three years). Very poor, very disappointing and not something what I would ever expect from such a 'name'. It felt to me that The Ritz is now living off its name, and not its service or attention to detail. I note that a number of comments on my blog about the experience suggested that I am not alone with my experience.It was so awful that i received an offer by email for a free night's B and B. I emailed the hotel out of interest to see if I could book. Two months later, no reply. Says it all really. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.", December 2013, Travelled solo

It was rather too busy, with packed in tables.The smoked salmon was 'too slippery' for my taste and the mint meringues were left by quite a few tables.The scones were fabulous and the strawberry jam was the best I have tasted in a long time.The turndown service at night was excellent and they put real rose petals on our bed for our anniversary.Shoes were left outside the door at night for cleaning.The breakfast buffet was the best I have ever had, which made it easier to pay the very high price.Beautiful croissants, fresh squeezed orange juice, every possible kind of fruit, and cooked food if you wanted it.The main reason I loved the Ritz so much was the staff.They were faultless in their service,  but did their job without being' inyour face ' all the time. All prices inluded service and vat, which I prefer.There is nothing more irritating than needing a pocket full of money for fauning staff. The Ritz staff are discreet, efficient and friendly.On our last day it was raining and they even loaned us an umbrella.The bottom line is I would go again in an instance, and although it is very, very expensive I felt that  it was worthevery penny.

JonMcKnight,3,1,The Ritz? You'll love it to bits,[5.0],"There are hotels, and then there is The Ritz. Immortalised in song, and internationally recognised as shorthand for ""the best"", The Ritz is simply the most stylish hotel on the planet.Resplendent in Piccadilly, and rubbing shoulders with Green Park, Mayfair, Clarence House, St James's, Jermyn Street, and Fortnum & Mason, The Ritz sets the standards that other fine hotels aspire to.From the moment you're greeted by the liveried doormen as you slip through the revolving door in St James's Street, you feel you're entering an exclusve world - a world in which good manners, dress sense and consideration for others prevail.Unless you happen to live in a Louis XVI chateau and are used to such splendour, it's rather difficult not to be impressed by the decor at The Ritz.Ornate plasterwork, gilding and antique furniture abound, creating an atmosphere that can only be described as palatial.While other hotels merely have corridors, The Ritz has The Long Gallery. It runs the length of the hotel, past the world-famous Palm Court on the left, where Tea At The Ritz became, and remains, an institution, and a pianist or harpist plays gently in the background.On the right is the Marie Antoinette Suite, a wonderfully elegant private function room where Princess Diana used to entertain her friends, Winston Churchill, President de Gaulle and President Eisenhower decided the course of World War Two, and I was fortunate enough to have had my wedding ceremony and reception almost 10 years ago.Noel Coward wrote songs at The Ritz, Charlie Chaplin drew an unprecedented crowd in the street outside when he stayed there, and Prince Charles has awarded it his Royal Warrant for banqueting and catering services. As he only lives around the corner but still chooses to frequent The Ritz, it doesn't get better than that.The Long Gallery leads to The Ritz Restaurant, a sumptuous, splendid room that lives up to its claim to be the most beautiful in Europe.The sweeping staircase is a thing of beauty in itself, and the lifts are the last word in opulence with panelling, gilding and mirrors all round.Rooms are all different, with individual themes, but you can expect antique furniture as standard and a level of comfort that few hotels can match.But while the physical splendour is all very well, the real secret of The Ritz is its staff.Whether you're an old-money billionaire or someone of very modest means with a taste for the high life, the staff at The Ritz will treat you with the same respect, discretion and interest.My daughter, taken there for a drink in The Long Gallery at the age of six, will never forget the way she was treated by the staff from The Rivoli Bar.She'd just finished her Diet Coke and was about to open her mouth to say ""Daddy, do you think I could have another one, please?"" when a liveried waiter appeared out of thin air and topped up her glass before she could even form a syllable.He must have been watching from the other side of the gallery and had such finely-honed anticipatory skills that he knew precisely when to approach without even being asked.And when we stayed in a suite on another visit, my daughter announced that the pull-out sofa bed wasn't comfortable enough.This was surprising, but we reported it to Housekeeping and were flabbergasted a few minutes later when no fewer than seven staff arrived with a mattress and pillows and spent a considerable time re-making the bed until even the Princess in the pea story would have admitted to being blissfully comfortable.Nothing was too much trouble for them, and they couldn't have made my daughter feel any more special if she'd come from the Palace across Green Park.I've stayed at The Ritz quite a few times, mostly on wedding anniversaries, and find the staff and their Managing Director, Stephen Boxall, unfailingly courteous, attentive and accommodating.The only gripe I ever had was that The Ritz used to charge considerably for internet access, but high-speed wi-fi now comes free of charge for all guests as a result of Mr Boxall's policy of listening to guests' feedback rather than simply decreeing what's best for them.Once, as a treat for my wife, we stayed in two Ritzes in 24 hours, waking up in The Ritz in London then, thanks to Eurostar, going to bed in The Ritz in Paris.Both excellent hotels, beyond a doubt, but we preferred the one in London by a mile. Despite the one in Paris being the original and the one in London following a few years later, The Ritz London had a je ne sais quoi that set it apart from, and above, its Parisian counterpart in the Place Vendome.The decor was more chic and elegant, somehow more French than the one in France, and the rooms just seemed to be superior.For readers who share my lack of luck on the Lottery, it's possible to have a taste of The Ritz in London for tens of pounds rather than tens of thousands, simply by booking a table in The Long Gallery and sitting there with a coffee while the world and his wife go by.For a special occasion, you can have Afternoon Tea At The Ritz in The Palm Court for about £100 for two, while an overnight stay in even its cheapest room offers you all the advantages that those paying telephone numbers for the most prestigious suites enjoy.The Ritz prides itself on being a place where guests can relax and enjoy their privacy, whoever they are. Celebrities who prefer being pestered by paparazzi whenever they leave their hotel tend not to stay at The Ritz, as cameras are banned in the public areas and the publicity-seeking would be deeply disappointed.Naturally, even The Ritz has its critics. I see that one reviewer on TripAdvisor, Eric R, describes ""the place"" as ""very stuck up and rude"" and refers to the ""afternoon rip-off tea"".I suspect that The Ritz simply isn't for him, nor does it concur with what his idea of good manners might be.And while he's entitled to describe Afternoon Tea At The Ritz as ""a rip-off"" at £100 for two, there are certainly places nearby where he could have it for a tiny fraction of the price. And no doubt have been surrounded by people he felt more at home among.But I suspect he's missing the point. People do not pay £100 for tea for two because they're especially thirsty, or looking for the best way to stretch their budget; they go to The Ritz because it's the epitome of style and elegance, a glamorous experience, and offers a taste of a lifestyle that most of us, if we are honest, would love to enjoy on a daily basis.In my experience, malcontents of the sort who consider The Ritz to be ""stuck up"" tend not to go there anyway as they'd clearly not feel comfortable in such sophisticated surroundings.That leaves it a more pleasant place for the rest of us, who aooreciate the levels of service that Mr Boxall insists upon and which his staff work tirelessly to uphold.To out-Ritz the original Ritz in Paris, and to keep doing so, is an achievement of which he and his staff have every right to be proud.", December 2013, Travelled with family
mwtravelnotes,19,17,Ritz Afternoon Tea Experience with mum,[4.0],"We headed to the Ritz at the begging of the year as my mum mentioned she'd never been and really wanted to check out their décor, have tea and walk around the place. I booked the Afternoon tea for 3 people and the confirmation/arrangement came in really fast. We enjoyed our tea slot (as you gather around the team lounge just before your designated time slot as per booking). The lounge looked spectacular and many places presented an excellent photo opportunity. we took lots of photos with the flower pots, at the table and just outside the bar.The tea selection was fantastic, really unusual choices and excellent service. We choice orange blossom and Lapsang Suchong. The sandwiches made with tuna/cucumber, ham etc. was mediocre, and we expected it to be honest given the nature of the afternoon tea and the menu. The scones looked very different from usual Cornish variety - I think they are catered for tourists and therefore are lacking in taste/crumbly texture.We really enjoyed this time with mum - as this was arranged for her. My husband took lots of pictures and at the end we checked out the jewellery store which had a few interesting necklaces/earring sets. I would recommend the afternoon tea if you want to impress your family or a guest from overseas, it is a great pastime on Saturday morning/afternoon. Booking in advance is a must as it is extremely busy.The tea can be combined with visiting the Royal Academy of Arts nearby as well as the Burlington Arcade.", February 2014, Travelled with family

BH2425,6,2,Birthday Treat,[5.0],"My eldest daughter arranged a surprise birthday treat for my mother (90th) and myself (60th) at The Ritz. We had Afternoon Tea accompanied by my two daughters and my granddaughter (aged 7). It was a 'Ladies Only' outing.My granddaughter was treated beautifully, from being seated at the table to her own sandwiches 'in case she didn't like the ones for more adult taste.' (She ate those and some of the others). She was not treated as a child when it came to anything including choosing her own tea.  She chose 'Mint Infusion' which she enjoyed. Her tea was poured and 'topped up' the same as ours by the waiters, she was not overlooked.  Her presence and enjoyment mattered to the staff as much as ours.  She thoroughly enjoyed herself.  She thought everything was beautiful and the Powder Room fantastic.  She is still talking about it over a week later!My mother enjoyed the whole experience, the food, the tea, the piano and the ambience.  Also, the champagne and the birthday cake which appeared with candles, accompanied by the pianist playing 'Happy Birthday'. People sang and clapped. She and my father have enjoyed looking at the book about The Ritz received with the cake.  She said it was 'a once in a lifetime experience for her'.My daughters and I also enjoyed the afternoon for all the same reasons but also because of their enjoyment too.From the moment we stepped out of the car at the front entrance, to the moment we were ushered out into the traffic and heading home, we could not have asked for a better service. Mum thought the waving from all the staff outside as we drove by was brilliant too. As one would expect it was friendly, helpful, efficient and much more.  We can all recommend the experience.A fantastic venue complete with fantastic staff.

KimChloe073,114,51,Did not live up to expectations,[2.0],"Oh dear. We had a two night stay with a Clarence House Shopping experience. The package did not deliver what it was supposed to. The Clarence House experience was supposed to include a private tour. It did not. We had a poor set menu (no choice) for The Ritz dinner - we asked then for a choice and were given choices of three for each course - the table next to us, also on the package, also complained and they were offered a la carte. Cooked breakfast was very ordinary and on the first morning there was no waiter allocated to our table so we were forgotten and when we did order, the waiter bought half of the wrong food (e.g. fried not poached egg, mushroom omelette, not ham omelette). I have been offered a free night with breakfast as compensation for the experience.  The bedroom was superb and the bed one of the most comfortable I have stayed in. On our last morning, my husband and I went for a walk and when we returned (at 11:45), despite telling the front desk that we would check out at 12 noon, our room had been completely cleared - and our luggage was still in there! We couldn't even wash our hands! My advice - check that the package that you are ordering is what you want and are expecting. Our organiser had not checked with Clarence House (a basic fundamental error) so the experience was different to the year before (she had assumed that the itinerary would be the same as the previous year), During the whole stay I spoke to the staff about the problems (I do not believe in leaving and suddenly saying that the stay was not up to expectations) and the staff were extremely uncomfortable about taking feedback that was not positive. One member of staff actually asked whether the stay was meeting our expectations. We said 'no' and she ignored us and didn't follow the comment through. Staff definitely need training in how to deal with constructive criticism. I do hope that The Ritz will learn from this package and review the way that they market such experiences in order to manage clients' expectations.", November 2014, Travelled with family

MizzPB,37,28,Putting on the Ritz!,[5.0],"My partner booked us in on this package and it was worth every penny. The surroundings are olde worlde elegance, from the Ritz tearoom to its fabulous dining room, with mirrors, marble and silverware everywhere.  We arrived to a proper Cockney welcome from the doorman (who summoned cabs at will) and waited in the Rivoli Bar until our room was ready (early check-in request), drinking the most divine freshly squeezed orange juice so as not to spoil the bottle of chilled champagne awaiting us in our room.  As it is central London, there is no real view to speak of, just the hustle and bustle of the traffic below but that all added to the experience as I love London anyway. Our room was perfect and quite a good size, considering it is an old building though the bathroom was smaller than we expected - but perfectly formed in an Italian Marble style. As the final inspection was completed, I requested an iron and ironing board, assuming that my message would be passed on and one would arrive half an hour later. Not so, within minutes it was done...and that is where the Ritz really excels all over hotels: its staff. Everything was provided either without asking or upon asking. Afternoon Tea was wonderful and this is the first place where we have had our sandwiches and cakes refilled time and again - without even asking! They even brought round further sweet trolleys. It is no wonder that people must return again and again. The pianist took requests and played our favourites, enhancing the romance of it all then came over for a brief chat at the end. The waiters were sublime, everywhere yet nowhere at the same time. Our visit to the casino later in the evening was fun - we won, though didn't bet very much compared to the hundreds and thousands being forfeited all around us. The bed was superb, with a lovely turn down service and linen mats to put your feet on before getting into bed.  Another first. Breakfast was in the vast dining room amidst many cosmopolitan companions and a small army of waiters. We had a window seat looking out onto the terrace, which must be lovely in the summer. The engraved  Ritz tableware made our cooked breakfast all the more delicious - and there was a huge variety to choose from in the continental buffet selection too. Another lovely chat with the Head Waiter and we headed back, reluctantly, to pack up. Reception were only too happy to supervise our luggage till our flights later that evening which left us time to shop. I would have gone back for another Afternoon Tea if I could. No wonder it is world famous! We had an amazing stay, even if all too brief, and I know where I will be returning to if my numbers come up on the lottery and I need to contemplate how to spend my winnings. To top it all off, I provided an online review to the Ritz and received a very lengthy and beautifully worded email from its Manager the same day. It simply summed up the detailed and genuine care and attention we experienced throughout. Highly recommended.", October 2014, Travelled as a couple

RobbyJYork,466,172,The one and only,[5.0],"The Ritz has to get 5 stars. Any less and you're not comparing like with like. There is literally nothing like it as an overall experience. Is everything perfect? No it isn't. Is everything to everybody's taste? Definitely not. Is it unique, memorable and special? Yes, yes yes.The service you get is definitely old fashioned and I mean this in a positive way. The staff are slightly aloof as they would have been a century ago. However, I happily exchanged a little banter with the bar waiter and one of the doormen. Some may interpret this as being overly haughty but it was not at all my impression. All staff I met couldn't do enough to help, from maids, to room service, waiter staff and concierges. Unfortunately when we arrived, there was a slight hiccup with the service. The receptionist showed us to the bar because the room was not quite ready and offered us a drink. There was clearly a communication problem between the reception and bar, resulting in no drink, but that was a minor issue. I had to call housekeeping a couple of times, who couldn't have been quicker and more helpful in their response.We had a superior room for two nights. The room itself is old but quite well designed. It had character and a great deal of charm. Of course, I've stayed in more practical rooms but that's not what you buy into in the Ritz.  The bed was fantastic, sheer luxury with thick sheets large pillows and even a headboard cover (everything is 'Ritz' monogrammed). There is an electric shutter for total blackout which was great. Air con is adequate but only because it is discreetly located near the window. Not ideal, but did the job on a warm night. Oddly, there are no tea/coffee facilities. You are made to order room service for this.  As a tea junkie, I found this the biggest problem because I still find difficulty justifying spending £7 on tea 10 times a day!  No problem if I'm in the bar though. The room was, of course immaculately clean. The turn down service was, if anything, a little over the top. My wife is a little OCD and went bananas when all her make-up had been neatly laid out on a cloth in the bathroom. I thought it was a lovely touch, but that illustrates the point that the over-the-topness isn't everybody's game of cricket.  They also lay out slippers on another cloth by the bed.  I would have liked a chocolate on my pillow, but there we go!  There are bathrobes and no, none fitted a big lad like me as they never do!  It's not the sort of thing you can ring down for to fix.  'I'm too fat for your minuscule bath robes, do you have one for a pie junkie?'  I'd rather do without thanks...  The towels are thicker than a duvet. The bath fills in exactly 30 seconds, views from the room are great. There are 3 phones in the room.  They've done all they can to make the room experience as comfortable and hassle free as possible. There are nail kits, nice moisturizers, the usual shower cap but no shoe shine which was surprising given that there are no shoe shine machines in corridors either. I forgot my toothbroush, so room service delivered a tooth kit very promptly.In our 2 days, we had evening dinner and tea at the Ritz on one afternoon.  The dining room at the far end of the hotel is beautiful and opulent and very Edwardian.  We almost felt like we were going to hit an iceberg. Menu choices are varied, which include a good selection of sharing plates, such as venison wellington, which we had. There's even a dessert sharing plate on the menu priced at £45. I had langoustines to start. There were 4 or 5 on the plate and had already been shelled. The sauce was a little over the top though.  The wellington main was fantastic. The truffle interior kept it moist and the red wine gravy complimented the venison well.  Wines were expensive, but the somellier was on hand to recommend a moderately priced bottle to go with the wellington. Service was a little too attentive, for example we were asked if we wanted desserts 4 times by different waiters which just started to get irritating.My biggest bugbear was the bar. My wife loves it and this was our 7th visit, so I grin and bear it.  The bar itself is quite small, but very attractively decorated. One issue with the Ritz is that staff don't always have a good command of English. Now, if that comes across as xenophobic, I'd better explain that I'm Spanish. They are decent Euro-English speakers, but that is not the same.  Some more colloquial phrases are lost on them which led to some language barriers and some southern European accents were difficult to understand.  This was the case in the bar, where the waitress explained some differences in the Manhattan and choices of champagne, but due to the hubbub in the bar and the language issue, it was largely lost on us. This was also the case in the restaurant and in afternoon tea where a plate of sandwiches was prematurely taken away due to language barriers and it was too late and too much hassle to retrieve them.  Back to the bar...  The waitress poured my manhattan at an increasing height, presumably for the theatre of it and in so doing, splashed it all over me. Totally unnecessary. As it happened, the orange bitters I had unwittingly agreed to were totally overpowering, particularly since the garnish also was part orange. Angostura with orange garnish would have worked fine.  The next day we had tea in the bar but the waitress poured it immediately before it was even brewed, which was a cardinal sin.  As all Spanish anglophiles, yes, I'm a tea snob. However the darjeeling leaf tea was very high quality.  They could clearly see my shock at the tea faux-pas and interestingly, didn't repeat it the second day. They dutifully delivered the tea and let me pour it.On our last morning, room service arrived with a complimentary half bottle of champagne at 8.30 which was the nicest of touches. We left the Ritz having had a wonderful two days. Would I return? probably not because I like to do different experiences and the Ritz is just that, an experience, and an unforgettable one at that.", October 2014, Travelled as a couple

Staff seemed to more interested in running around for the gents on the table next to us! Don't know who they were but didn't think it was right we were left out.

This was our 2nd visit to the ritz and was just as enjoyable as our first visit. We arrived a couple of hours early. Did this matter? Of course it didn't; the ritz had it covered. Whilst our rooms were being prepared we were kindly taken  to the ""Rivoli Bar"", a beautiful bar, set in the heart of the Ritz. We enjoyed a cup of tea and a delicious salmon dish. The food was perfect.Once we had indulged ourselves in what they had to offer, we were taken to our room by a lovely, helpful women. Our room was a deluxe room, it was to die for! The incredible attention to detail hit us straight away like before, we were in dream land once again!This visit to the ritz was for the celebration of my birthday, and what an incredible birthday it was! At 9:00pm, it was time to dine in the ""Ritz Restaurant"", which was beautiful, said to be one of the most beautiful rooms in the world. The food was impeccable, and the presentation was Michelin star standard.For all those reading this review thinking this is all very well but it's too expensive, all I have to say is this, yes it is, but you will realise that there is nothing better you could of chosen to spend your money on, and that's a promise.Thank you to all the Ritz staff who made our stay at the Ritz, once again, an unforgettable experience.Robert Ulrich on behalf of the Ulrich family.", October 2014, Travelled with family

The building and hotel have a lot of history and the interior decor makes you feel like a royal. The staff were very courteous and helpful but not overly friendly. We did not mind the dress code of the hotel and it helps create that impression that staying at the Ritz is special. The room we stayed in was a bit worn and needed an update. The room size was generous for London but the bed, furnishings, carpet, and bathroom just needed something extra to make it the Ritz. We had breakfast at the Ritz and it was done very nicely. Everyone should get to experience eating at the Ritz. The wait staff do their job really well! The food for breakfast was fine. You are paying for the service after all.Overall my wife and I had a good stay. Maybe we expected more because it is the Ritz. We have stayed at Hotel 41 on another trip and felt is was a bit cozier without all the pomp and circumstance of the Ritz.

Yes, some of the decor looks as though it could do with sprucing up and some of the carpets etc would look better for a clean, but having said that it was a wonderful experience!  The staff were polite without being effusive, the service was absolutely impeccable (tea cup refilled within seconds of it being emptied) and the food was very good.  Fresh sandwiches, delicious tea and champagne, big pots full of both jam and cream to go with the scones and wonderful small cakes plus gateau from the trolley.  I ate the best orange macaroon I have ever tasted and the chocolate slice was so rich I couldn't finish it.  We were offered, and accepted, more sandwiches and the waiting staff, while very professional, were not above agreeing to take photographs or pose with people to be photographed themselves.  The live pianist added to the atmosphere and enjoyment - although my husband smiled when the pianist asked a young man waiting for his wife to emerge from the powder room whether he could play something for him and the young man responded 'can you play 'Great balls of fire'?'.  Yes, of course it's ridiculously expensive, but we were happy to pay because we realised it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. All the people having tea seemed to be once-only people, although there were a couple of elderly ladies who might well have made it a regular occurrence!

Gaallstars,7,17,"Well, Well, Well,",[3.0],"Like old Mrs. Habersham herself, creeping around these old hallways, I find myself less “Ritzier” than upon arrival.  I’m an American staying this past week at the Ritz Hotel in London.  I have never been in a position to afford such “fancy” places and have always waited patiently in my station until my job, age, and cultural etiquette would afford me to do so.  I treated myself this past trip to a week at the Ritz.  “Treat” in any regard, is a misnomer in my experience.  I found the staff to be overly haughty, looking through you not at you.  Please have on a suit and tie or Dior vintage upon arrival, and plan on staying in such fashions your entire stay- even to the DISMAL workout room.  Otherwise, the staff, right down to the bellman, will give you the old British “up and down” followed with an exasperated breath of disappointment.  I prefer sightseeing in cargo shorts, and sneakers.  Oh the commonality.The drinks were “over-engineered” like bad architecture from the Fountainhead.  The food was sauced to death, and had it tasted as good as the chipped china it came on looked – would have been an 8 at best   the hallway had some machine to rid the air of mildew.  The elevator looked like the Fairmont Copley of my youth – you remember” Guests of the Marv Griffith Show stay at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. “  The pillows, which I had to have changed were 2 foot tall, and useless for sleep, maybe an attempt to overcompensate for the mattress, born in 1964. Bathrooms, Athenian.Carpets and bedding- worn.Internet- Waiting to post this at the airport.No irons for the room, and 100 brochures around the room convincing you that you are in fact, staying at one of the NICEST most HISTORICAL hotels in London.  They’re off by a few letters- HYSTERICAL -on both price, and service. Grand…OLD…Dame.  Save the money – stay at Hilton.  Or spend the money, and stay at the Mandarin Oriental, but leave this old girl to die in peace.  And please spare me the speech on how I as an American can’t appreciate anything over 100 years old.

We came in one day from shopping (we were wearing jeans and nice ones at that) and went to go to the bar to wait for my in laws and the concierge quite abruptly said 'where are you going?' It was almost as if we shouldn't have been there.  Once we explained we were staying in the hotel, he just said ok. No apology or anything.

Ritz London is a grand property but it's strict rules and policies which I fully respect and understand can sometimes confuse their employees who may not have the experience to handle some specific situations. Afternoon tea wich I love is unique at this property but I believe a too well known adresse so a little too busy to relax and enjoy the experience.

world explorer,111,159,High Tea,[5.0],"You got to put this on your bucket list! First of all, you better book at least 3 months in advance. If you are going in JULY do it a 6 months in advance.The times start at 11:30, and the last time is 7:30PM. Who wants tea at night? And 11:30 is way too early unless you did not have breakfast at your hotel. My friends and I chose 15:30. This was perfect for us because we were super hungry, and it gave us time to walk there.So guys must wear a coat and tie, which is no problem. You show up, and right from the start they treat you like you are supeer special. You walk into the huge Palm Court- and once you see people you are GLAD you dressed up!  The tables are close together and a piano is playing, and soon you get to choose which tea you want from the menu. I have been drinking Earl Grey for the past few years, just because of the relaxing effect- and the Ritz has one of the best selections I have ever tried! Earl Grey goes perfect with all the sandwiches, and the scones, and as the people walk in, and the music playes, and you are eating the wonderful cakes and sandwiches you will just feel like a million pounds! They keep restocking the sandwiches which is nice. I noticed that most people only eat a few, but we were restocked 5 times! So you have plenty of time to eat, and drink, and who knows but you might see a member of the Royal family (so they say). Afterwards wander around the hotel lobby, then go to the park next door, and I promise it will be one of the greatest memories of your life!  Oh..........if you want, visit the Twinings free museum in London. It is a little museum that gives a HUGE history of the tea business in London.

Geoff_B_Dublin,99,48,Treated Like Royalty,[5.0],"We loved our night in The Ritz, from the second we walked through the doors we were treated like royalty by the superb staff. John (I think) checked us in and the hotel makes a point of using solid metal keys rather than cards so as to ensure contact between checkin staff and guest. We were celebrating two 50th birthdays and because the hotel had taken the time to email us in advance of our arrival, they knew this and had left birthday cakes in each room. The rooms are beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean and the staff make a point of asking you if there is anything they can do, rather than waiting to be asked. We spent some time in The Rivoli Bar (note: sports shoes not allowed) and each cocktail I had was excellent and again, the staff are top notch.

Our trip to The Ritz was for a double celebration – my birthday and we were also celebrating our engagement. I mentioned this when booking but didn’t think it would make a difference. Anyway we were upgraded from an Executive King Room to a suite which was wonderful, and I even got a birthday cake the next day which was a nice touch.The Ritz may not be to everyone’s taste (if you are looking for something contemporary then go elsewhere) but we love the classical style of it. Yes there’s the odd crack in the ceiling coving but The Ritz is a grand old girl still turning heads after all these years despite the odd wrinkle!They gave us rose petals on the bed too which was a nice touch. Excellent turndown service each night with complimentary bottled water.I was initially worried it would be a bit pretentious after reading some reviews on here but not at all. The staff were superb and remembered us each time we returned to the hotel. No stuffiness, just good old fashioned top-notch service.Breakfast was out of this world, in the lavish dining room. From the smoked salmon to the quails eggs to the eggs Benedict to the fresh cloudy apple juice...I was in heaven.The Rivoli bar is a must. I was very slightly disappointed by the fact I had gone out of my way to ensure I was wearing jacket, tie and trousers yet upon arrival there were other guests not adhering to the policy which the staff didn’t seem to mind.  Yes they still looked perfectly smart, but I would have rather joined them and worn something less formal than I did but I had read everywhere how strict the dress code was.We sampled a few of the cocktails on offer which, whilst not the cheapest, were still good value based on the ingredients, presentation and of course the taste. We checked out the Ritz Club casino late one night which was an experience. Not being huge gamblers it was still nice to go and have a bit of a flutter on the roulette tables. We noted that the drinks in the Ritz club are cheaper than anywhere else in the hotel.Also we were heading for dinner nearby at the Savoy Grill and as one of the hotel cars (Merc S Class) was available they let us take that rather than get a taxi as we weren’t going far. Location is fantastic, right next to Green Park tube station.

The opulent fabrics and decor; the abundance of fresh flowers and the sheer majesty of the surroundings, leave you in awe.

I'll get the negatives out of the way first:We arrived on the 31st. August which was the eve of of Anniversary. The check in girl knew of our celebration and immediately upgraded us to a larger room which was a nice touch. Unfortunately this larger room was next to a noisy service area full of bins and service equipment which we noticed immediately. There was a constant bang,crash of bottles and doors banging. Not good, so we asked to be moved as I could foresee noisy problems. The alternate room we were offered was a downgrade as we were told the Hotel was fully booked. Now not wishing to sound ungrateful as this room was after all a free upgrade, I respectfully asked if there was another room available but was told the hotel was full and we either had to have that room or the noisy one. We both thought that as this was the world famous Ritz something better should surely we offered and after a little moan to one of the duty managers a lovely huge suite was found for us ! This suite was seriously good.From there on our stay could not have been better.From the whole ambiance of the Hotel to all of the staff, it was apparent that this was indeed a very special place.It almost felt like a small intimate country Hotel rather than the imposing place it is such was the atmosphere. It was so quite and relaxing. That first evening we decided to eat at the Ivy close by which was lovely and has always been consistently good. Breakfast in the morning was tip top ! Amazing selection and perfect in every single way. I mean really perfect. The hotels restaurant is a truly Fabulous room. Opulent in a grand and wonderful old fashioned way.Dinner the next evening  was pretty good although my wife had the Turbot which was way over seasoned and almost inedible due to over salting. In fact she left most of it. They were very good about it but we didn't like to make a fuss.Bedrooms were spotless and very comfortable. Our bathroom was enormous !Summing up, the impression we both left with was of a lovely sense of well being and of having experienced something very special. This is a Hotel of understated old fashioned splendor with excellent service and we cant wait to stay there again. Maybe every Anniversary from now on !", August 2014, Travelled as a couple

Emulhall,22,18,Absolute perfection ,[5.0],"I cannot rate The Ritz highly enough. Recently married, my new husband decided that as it was his birthday and because we needed a night away by ourselves just get a bit of breathing space after the wedding and chose The Ritz as a treat.  I am so glad he did. The concierge contacted us via email just before our visit to ask if we had any special requirements from the hotel (I'm assuming this was referring to disability arrangements or things like that). My husband being as cheeky as he is decided to inform the hotel that we were recently married and it was also his birthday and the concierge said he walking get back to us. We heard nothing more....... Upon arriving at the hotel we were warmly greeted by the doormen and our bags taken as usual. When we tried to check in we were told our room wasn't quite ready so we went to the bar for a drink. The setting was lovely and the bar staff very attentive so we decided not to even bother going out to lunch and just stayed in the hotel.  The food was fantastic by the way... When we eventually got back to reception we were told that our room hadn't been ready as we had been upgraded from a standard room to a junior suite in celebration of our wedding! The room was lovely and immaculately clean. A beyond perfect start to our trip. We were then in our room and a maid knocked on our door at about 6 pm and asked me what time we would like out turn down service. I told her that we were going out for dinner at around 8 so any time after that.  At around quarter to 8 we then had a knock at the door and a member of staff came in to the room with a card, birthday cake and a box of hand made chocolates from the hotel for my husbands birthday. He was absolutely over the moon! We then went out for dinner and upon returning found that our turn down service also included a rose petal heart on the bed and rose petals sprinkled everywhere. All the staff greeted me with my new married name even though they'd probably only seen me once that day. The entire experience at The Ritz was fantastic and I encourage anyone to go there to experience it for yourselves. We all know The Ritz has an amazing reputation but it is a place that should be on your top 10 hotels to visit list! The food can be fantastic and the building can be lovely but, if you've read any of my other reviews, my biggest focus when going anywhere is on the service. The little things matter and the attention to detail makes all the difference. We haven't been in a honeymoon yet but, even though it was only one night, we had such a fantastic time because of The Ritz we tell everyone it was our mini-moon. :-)", September 2014, Travelled as a couple

psbmd25,16,90,Stay Away!,[1.0],"I travel I travel extensively ( so far about 250,000 miles this year) and I normally stay in a five-star hotels which is how I ended up at the Ritz. The location is excellent in London but it is downhill from there. I only stayed there for a day and a half but from the time I checked in which was about 2 PM until the time I left which was approximately 6 AM a day and a half later the number of things that were done improperly or went wrong was extensive and certainly not what one would expect from a hotel that charges what they do and is considered one of the best hotels in London. I am afraid it is living on its reputation and current management is not doing this hotel justice. Here are just a few of the things that occurred:When I checked in I was severely jetlagged and tired I requested a bucket of ice and not to be disturbed. Two hours later the bucket of ice had not arrived I tried calling room service but the phone in the room didn't work so I used my cell phone to call the desk approximately 10 o'clock at night the doorbell to my room rang and it was turndown service that woke me from a deep sleep.The next day the phone still didn't work even though I reported it and although I left at nine in the morning and return at three in the afternoon the room was never made up. I took a shower and found that the bathroom had filled with several inches of water since the drain in the shower didn't work and the seal on the glass shower door on the bottom was gone so the water just flowed into the bathroom.

If I'm being overly picky I probably could have done without the piano rendition of ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life,"" but that was the only un-perfect moment. The hotel stay, however, is pretty hard to justify.  The cost of a night's stay here is astronomical and though The Ritz is steps away from Trafalgar Square, museums and some lovely shopping, the cost, in our minds, doesn't make any bit of sense despite the amenities.  The room's are a good size, clean, cared for and the service is quite good - I wouldn't try and take those things away from the experience, but, in truth, you really are paying a premium for the ""Ritz"" name without getting much in return in terms of tangible value; at least that's my opinion.There are a lot of places to stay in London that are equally as nice at half the cost, you just don't get the Ritz name.", September 2014, Travelled on business

Being booked into the famous Ritz was a real treat although completely lost on the children, however we had a junior suite on the seventh floor which we thought was pretty special. On arrival the doorman was charming, he welcomed us and made an effort to read the luggage labels on our suitcases to make thing personal, he did misread our name and called us something completely different all weekend but we didn't mind. After checking in we left our bags and I took the kids out to see the sights. The weather was hot so we were dressed in shorts and t-shirts, when we got back to the hotel we felt slightly out of place and a bit awkward. There were lots of people who were arriving for afternoon tea or for drinks in the bar all dressed to the nines. Needless to say we were ushered to the nearest lift.The room or should I say rooms were big but we felt were a little tired, one of the kids was sleeping on a bed settee which meant we couldn't  really enjoy the lounge, the TV in the bedroom had very poor reception and the shower was rubbish.

There is a dress code, so check before or go smart.( no jeans etc) the decor was sumptuous and elegant. Great attention to detail,  even in the cloakroom and toilets. The afternoon tea was at 7.30pm. Be prepared to spend between 50 to 70 pounds each.....but it is a wonderful experience and the sandwiches, cakes, scones, tea is frequently topped up by handsome waiting staff. You are meant to stay for 2 hours , but I found going at 7.30 it was much more relaxed with time keeping. Everyone should experience the Ritz at least once. champagne was exquisite.", August 2014, Travelled with friends

Both breakfast and dinner were first class as were all the members of staff we encountered. The only down side was the bed, it squeaked and was a little uncomfortable; no amount of toppers or excellent pillows could disguise the 'sleep easy' beds pushed together. This should have been a 5 star review, everything but the bed certainly was but for the money we paid there should be nothing to detract from the experience and the bed did.", July 2014, Travelled as a couple

Staff provided an impressive, exceptional and PERFECT service with a smile! Our bedroom was so elegant and awe inspiring. We had a bottle of champagne, a gorgeous bouquet of flowers (roses and lilies) and a small birthday cake awaiting us.  The bed was so comfortable, we had the best sleep ever!   The lobby was exquisite, luxurious and oozed in opulence and history, as we listened to the subtle tones of the harpist.  The evening meal was in the most regal of dining rooms I had ever experienced.  The food was superb, 'melt in the mouth' outstanding quality and taste.  Staff we're very approachable, attentive and faultless in their service.   The bar provided a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.  The next morning, breakfast was fabulous providing a huge and mouthwatering variety.   The whole experience was truly amazing and the service was excellent on all levels.  Our ride back to King's cross station in the Rolls-Royce Phantom was breath taking.  It really was the icing on the cake.

We booked a Deluxe King Room which was upgraded to a junior suite because of our anniversary, we also had champagne and chocolates in the room which was a nice touch.Michael the concierge was brilliant, we wanted drinks out of the hotel one night and his recommendation of Galvin at Windows was spot on.The two breakfasts we had were perfect, the buffet with a wide range of berries was great and the cooked breakfast also to a very high standard, the service was first class all round. On our anniversary night we ate in the main restaurant, the atmosphere was fantastic, the pianist and then the three piece string band was just perfect. At £190 I felt the meal and wine was reasonably priced.I can highly recommend the Ritz, its not over posh but has a lot of history which we liked.Thank you to Gabriella and Michael, also to the door staff and the young work experience porter who opened the doors with a big smile, as well as the rest of staff who made our 25th Anniversary very special indeed.

Carl L,67,51,Weekend Break,[3.0],This trip had been planned for quite some time so we were very excited. Unfortunately the hotel didn't live up to our expectations. The room (suite) whilst very roomy was a little tired and needed a bit of a lift- I don't expect it to be chic or modern but it was a bit dated and the large bathroom was dirty with a not so good shower area. The restaurant served great food but extremely expensive and the breakfast was just ok. Clearly the area where afternoon tea was served is steeped in history and amazingly popular as it pretty much full all of the time and I really liked the fact that people made an effort to dress up and enjoy the occasion but it lacked any feeling. I get the overall impression that the hotel is living off its history and I'm sure many more people will get to visit this hotel purely on its name alone when there are many more better hotels offering afternoon tea. We visited the The Connaught for drinks and instantly found this hotel and rooms/staff more accommodating and warmer., August 2014, Travelled as a couple

The staff were exceptional, as you would expect and any request was dealt with straight away.  The bedroom we had was large, well equipped and had plenty of nice white towels and bathrobes.  It was spotless.  One disappointment was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities.  The package we had cost over £600 and to be expected to pay £15 for a hospitality tray was a bit of a cheek.  The afternoon tea was set in a lovely room and a harpist created a very grand feeling.  It was lovely to see all the men dressed in jackets/ties and most of the ladies in nice dresses.  The sandwiches were good but having had tea at The Mount Nelson in Cape Town, in comparison felt the cakes to be boring, even though plentiful.On visiting the Casino, we found a service charge put on the price of our drinks, which surprised us.My breakfast was superb,  plenty of nice fresh fruit and kippers,  however, my husband had to send his full English back as the two fried eggs on his plate had no yolks.

This was a long awaited trip which was planned last year when I was having chemotherapy but could only come to fruition this year now that I am feeling better.The positives:1. The gift vouchers are beautifully presented 2. Making a reservation is straightforward but is booked months ahead so do book early3. The Ritz is like a beautiful jewel box - you feel special by just being there4.  The sandwiches, cakes, pastries and scones are delicious.5. The choice of teas is excellent6. Everyone makes an effort with dressing up which adds to the occasion7. There was a very good harpist playing which was beautifulThe cons:Sadly we found the service inconsistent - we were sat in the middle of two tables for two and could see the difference in service on each table. We were asked several times if we were having Champagne which we had paid for. We waited and watched the waiters come and go with the Champagne for other guests but it wasn't until our tea arrived that they realised we still had not received our Champagne.Both tables either side of us were offered tea refills several times whilst our table was ignored. Their plates were changed regularly and they were offered fresh scones etc. Little things make a big difference and I began to feel uncomfortable and could not work out why we were being overlooked. In fairness at the end of the tea we were asked if we had enjoyed it and I asked them if they would like some feedback. I told them about the inconsistencies of service and the duty manager was charming and offered us both another glass of Champagne which we declined as we thought it was good of him but by this time I felt embarrassed and just wanted to leave. He very kindly gave me a bag with a teddy, tea and chocolates which was thoughtful but I really would have preferred the same service as my fellow diners.

Time to leave!!! We then spoke to the head waiter who realised a mistake had been made and sorted it out. Thank you.3) I ordered the pork main course but received lamb. I really enjoy lamb so said nothing. No complaints. The head waiter subsequently realised a mistake had been made in the kitchen and apologised profusely. Again, thank you. Now, for me, although it was not necessary, this was the time to go the extra mile and many restaurants would do it; a complimentary drink would not have broken the bank and would have left me thinking that it's not all about profit. That didn't happen though. One for Management to consider!!4) Quality and taste of the food was superb. Quantity was non-existent. We expected this when we booked but it still came as a shock as to how little you can get on a plate. Perhaps this makes me a philistine but I do like to leave feeling satisfied. You do get as much bread etc as you want. We chose this ""experience"" so have no real issue with the quantity of food provided but, if you could feel aggrieved by a ""minimal"" plate, then best not select the menu we did. 5) Drinks are very expensive (as expected) - £9.50 for a bottle of lager, £6 for bottled water. 6) Waiter service was excellent but you could feel rushed if you allow it. Our 3 course meal lasted just over 1 hour.In summary, we are delighted we did this. The building itself  is amazing and so very grand, the standards set are very high and well maintained by the staff, the food and service were very good and we accepted the costs when we booked. On our way home on the train, we met a family of four who had just been to the Ritz for an Afternoon Tea. They thoroughly enjoyed it and were delighted at the quality / quantity provided.Will we return - the Afternoon Tea sounds good.", August 2014, Travelled as a couple
twickenhamteacher,57,30,Champagne afternoon tea at the Ritz,[5.0],"Having received an afternoon tea for two at the Ritz for my birthday, I was unsure as to what to expect quality wise.  The Ritz did not disappoint, the champagne is served upon being sat, then the sandwiches and the patisseries are brought to the table.  There are many waiters looking after the tables and one of these refills the sandwiches on your cake stand.  Another waiter brings additional cakes to your table from which you can choose from a selection.  We had sticky toffee and lemon drizzle.  Then the scones come out, jam and clotted cream is already on the table.  The choice of tea is very broad and the tea pot is refreshed as and when required.One is advised to arrive 5 minutes prior to the reservation slot, we arrived approx, 10 minutes early and were seated immediately.  We did not at any point feel rushed and the service was unobtrusive.  We were unsure as to whether or not we might be given a bill at the end to pay a service charge - this did not happen.  The voucher was taken at the beginning by the maitre de and money was not mentioned again!A very elegant and classy affair at the Ritz - I would thoroughly recommend the champagne afternoon tea to anyone wishing to celebrate in style or anyone looking to indulge themselves for a couple of hours!  Some top end hotels in London are rather stuffy and overly formal - the Ritz delivers class and prestige but without being pretentious.  There were numerous birthdays whilst we were there with cakes being brought out and the pianist playing happy birthday - with the diners joining in!

Franz K,125,64,Simply the Best,[5.0],"I stayed in London many many times for the last 25 years. However I had never a chance to stay at the Ritz. This time I took the opportunity and made an early enough reservation to get a room over the busy season at end of may. WOW! It takes quite a bit to make me speechless. From the doorman to the receptionist, the bell staff, the butler who showed us around the room and came back with English tea and fresh baked cookies, turn down service, all spot on. We never seen our maid(s) during the entire stay. Once we left the room, they must have miraculously gotten in and shortly after the room was done. I wish I would have stayed sooner in this Hotel. You have to celebrate their famous afternoon tea it is spectacular! But here is a warning to some of my American folks. There is a dress code for gents. You have to wear a jacket all the time in the hotel and for the restaurants even a tie. And if you don't like it, it will be enforced by providing you either a jacket and/or tie, no exceptions! If you think you are on vacation and you want to wear your shorts and flip flops along with your favorite t-shirt, this is not the place for you, go elsewhere.However, whatever yo need, whenever you need it, it will be discreetly arranged and you will get things done without questions, may it be just a thing you usually would not ask, or at departure, the right size taxi will be ready for you fully loaded with your luggage, even if it is plenty, once you step out of the door.

Abhibasu,100,48,Dinner and dance - Olde world charm!,[5.0],"My wife and I thought we would try our ballroom dance steps and booked the Ritz Diiner and Dance in London. You can even book it online.As they say, you don't get a second chance to make a first impression! From the footman at the main door all through the 3 hour programme, the presentation was simply outstanding. The dining room is simply awesome - reminds you of the old Hollywood movies. It was nice to see that guests took the dress code seriously for such a glittering occasion - with most sporting dinner jackets, although jacket and tie was fine.Waiters in tailcoats lent an air of extra elegance to what was almost like a movie set! The music by a small band was very 60s and earlier and the singer did a great job in keeping everyone busy. They also put up professional dance shows with a couple doing the tango, rhumba and cha cha cha.The fixed menu was very good although a wide a la carte menu is available. The wine list runs to about 30 pages (I think!), so take your time. The presentation of the food and the wine was charming with the person explaining the dishes and the sommelier offering suggestions.The only observation I had is that there seemed to be an urgency about things. The wine waiter would rush to refill our glasses although we had perhaps 1 sip only. I thought we were asked a trifle too much whether we had finished our course. A little less attention would help but it was only a minor blip in the overall outstanding performance.This is a great experience but it does not come cheap.

Staff were attentive and pleasant.  The sandwiches were delicious and the clotted cream scones freshly baked and still warm.  We had ordered in advance the Traditional Fruit Cake as a Birthday cake, which we were able to bring home and is delicious.The Dress Code is formal, no jeans, no trainers and jackets with ties for men, most of the ladies were in summer dresses.  99% of the Afternoon tea guests were wearing the appropriate attire, it would seem a shame to make all that effort and not come properly dressed.There were a couple of children there for our sitting, but I don't think we would have wanted to bring our 3 boys as I just don't think they would have appreciated it and to have spent all that money only to be distracted by children would have been a shame, in my opinion - but it depends on the occasion.  For us, it was a chance for couple time, being waited on hand on foot, being made to feel special.If you want to continue to soak up the atmosphere and make such a wonderful experience last a little bit longer you can sit outside the Palm Court and listen to the pianist, or purchase the teas and similar gifts at the Hotel Reception.

It is something that she and her mum always wanted to do but never got round to it so I thought it was about time we went. I was a little concerned as I had read a couple of reviews from vegans who had been for afternoon tea and had only been given fruit platters. I emailed the ritz to check that I would be getting cakes and they assured me I would. I wasn't disappointed! Although I couldn't have the scones which they had already told me in the email, I got a lovely selection of vegan cakes and simple but lovely sandwiches. My mummy had a fantastic selection of sandwiches and cakes plus the scones with clotted cream and jam and the celebration cake was brought out with all the others to the pianist playing happy birthday. It was just beautiful in the dining area and the staff could not have been more lovely. The pianist even played a few Elvis Presley numbers which made my day! We were both a bit worried about dress code and I made a last minute panic purchase of smart trousers and a blouse because I was worried my ditzy patterned summer dress looked a bit frumpy. I needn't have done this. It really is just a case of no jeans or trainers for ladies. I was also a little concerned about showing my arms as I have tattoos. Again I needn't have worried.

The Ritz is very formal but my kids were welcomed with teddy bears and ice cream vouchers upon arrival and each evening complimentary cookies and milk were delivered to our room which was a nice touch. We stayed in a junior suite and the room was beautiful and big enough for a family of four.The dining room where the breakfast was served was stunning and the breakfast was nice. The service at breakfast was great 2 days and not so good on our final day. We tried the afternoon tea and it was very good and reasonably priced for adults but I found the 30 pound charge for my 2 year old daughter to be almost as rich as the cakes that were served with the tea. We visited the bar and the cocktails were lovely and the service was great.The thing that negatively impacted our impression of this hotel was the front desk, a member of the front desk team was very rude to me to the point that I made a complaint to the duty manager. There was no follow up what so ever from the duty manager during my stay and I didn't feel that the matter was taken seriously at all. To add insult to injury the front desk made a transaction of 700 pounds on my credit card without consulting me one day prior to my departure and when I enquired about this the duty manager called me back and said that it was a mistake. Finally when I was checking out there were incorrect charges that had been made to my account, these charges were eventually removed but altogether the front desk certainly didn't impress me and I was also not impressed with the casual way that I felt my complaint was dealt with. Due to these issues and the price range of The Ritz it's hard for me to rate my stay any better than average even though there were certainly several aspects of our stay that we liked.", July 2014, Travelled with family
NoKidsWillTravel,410,195,Lives up to expectations,[4.0],"The Ritz was certainly what we expected, exquisite decor, outstanding service and while extremely formal, it did not have the arrogance and attitude of other 5 Star hotels like The Plaza in New York.  Like The Savoy, the Ritz gets it right my not presenting guests with bills when they use the restaurants, Rivoli or order services through the Hall Porters, instead you simply walk away and the cost is added to your room account.  You should be prepared that the hotel is very formal and while we expected it and have no issues, we tend to prefer a more relaxed 5 star experience such as, it would have been nice to enjoy the uncustomary 90 degree sunshine on the terrace without having to wear a jacket and tie.  In all, breakfast was the only part of the experience which was a little off-putting, where it seemed that if you dressed the part and were rude to staff, you got better service.  As Canadians, rudeness just isn't in our DNA, so we settled for less than perfect service.  Having said that, anyone who critiques the Tea at the Ritz experience, simply cannot be satisfied, the food and service are impeccable and well worth the price.In all, staying at the Ritz is an excellent experience and while you need to go into it expecting that it will be more formal than most of us are used to, they will still gladly recommend a good local pub and while I'm sure uncommon, they won't toss you out when you walk down the stairs wearing a Monty Python T-shirt on your way to Monty Python Live reunion show.", July 2014, Travelled as a couple

The ambience was enhanced by the playing of a piano softly in the lobby.We were offered  a menu and asked to choose from an array of teas from around the world, unfortunately, our initial ""grumpy"" waiter had very bad body odour which was off putting.Another polite, fragrant waiter appeared and took our tea order, a plate of beautifully cut fresh sandwiches and some cakes were then placed on the table including smoked salmon, egg and cress, cheddar cheese and pickle - the sandwiches were replaced as often as required by the waiters. The tea was also replenished without asking throughout are afternoon tea. Unfortunately, my wife's teapot handle was too hot to pick up, and a fresh one which wasn't as hot was brought promptly. Little touches were absent - the tea label on the teapot was hand scribbled ""English""The next course of scones, two plain and two fruit scones were then placed on the table. The scones were ""synthetic"" dry and were not the calibre that one would expect of an establishment such as the Ritz. The waiter then took of the lids from the pots containing jam and clotted cream without saying one word. The cakes were fresh though the selection was poor and again not the quite what you would expect from the Ritz. As mentioned by other reviewers, cakes are not allowed to be taken home in a box as we were told "" they had been out longer than an hour"".To conclude, I felt that the experience did not live up to my expectations of afternoon tea at a premier establishment as the Ritz.I have been fortunate enough to recently have afternoon tea at Claridge's which was a much better experience and I would recommend as an alternative.", July 2014, Travelled as a couple

However we didnt really get past the tea menu before having to place our tea order (...English tea of course !). Sandwiches and small but rich cakes came first - and then were replaced with a further supply !  Then came the warm fruit scones with jam and clotted cream and just when we were already feeling particularly full came a trolley with sticky toffee ( with a caramel cream topping) and lemon drizzle cake.

To be quite honest I have always been a Claridge's client but as my wife does not like the art deco style if the Claridge's I thought I should book there. When I made the reservation, months before through Booking.com, I asked for a quite room on a high floor overlooking Green Park. I was assigned room 227 which is on the second floor, overlooking the building across the backyard. I complained, and eas told that all executive rooms have similar view so I was offerd for an extra GBP100 (Euro 130 or $160) per night the last available deluxe room at the 5th floor (522) which was fine .Otherwise, the hotel is old and so are its customers which overfill the tea salon every afternoon (tea and sandwiches cost GBP46 p.p.!). Breakfast is very good (especially Bircher Musli, fruit, salmon and cheese), save the croissants and danish pastries which are tasteless. So if there are a few things to learn from my experience, 1. Book a deluxe room which was not offered by Booking.com -perhaps try the hotel's web, or a suite 2. Avoid room 227 3. Room 522 is fine 4. Avoid croissants and danish pastries 5.

Everyone who walks through the door gets treated as the most important person in a Ritz staff member's world at that given time. The staff are obviously very proud of where they work and love to put on a show for the guests- whether it is the cheeky over the top ""I can get that organised for you Madam"" of Michael the concierge; or the deft replacement of a tablecloth on an afternoon tea table by one of the highly skilled waiters, everyone does their job to perfection and as a sales and marketing professional I found the subtleties of the up-selling an absolute delight. Our room was glorious with all trimmings you expect of a high class establishment. The decor of the whole hotel was just breathtaking and the doorman remembered my name and what I was doing for the day and followed up to see how i went upon returning to the hotel later in the afternoon. Michael got us tickets for the dress circle for the Book of Mormon and did it with a great display of showmanship. We stayed at the Savoy for 2 nights prior and found that hotel was stilted and disinterested in us as guests in comparison to the Ritz.

This was the fourth time I checked into The Ritz, I was greeted by a very friendly Check in Clerk and told you will be on the 7th floor. You can only imagine I was very excited thinking highest floor, room with a view (it must be because I'm a returning guest). Boy was I wrong.  The 7th floor consists of, the beauty salon, the fitness centre, powder rooms, may doors off the hall with no description, not too many guests rooms.Room with a view...not! i looked onto the roof and brick wall covered in wires and I think the airconditioning for the whole hotel. The room and a very bad odour to it and is very, very tired. I don't think it gets used very often. I'm not sure why a hotel of this calibre even has a room of this standard. So when checking in and they tell your room number 705 Executive King avoid it. I should mention, when checking out and complaining to the Manager about the standard, he understood and did take some money off the final bill.

Just like another reviewer, we were there on a hot day (27 degrees outside) but my husband had to keep his jacket on which, couple with drinking hot tea it made him very uncomfortable and several stops to the toilet were required to cool off so maybe air con should be a consideration.All in all a lovely experience.

From the moment we arrived through to departure we all felt the Ritz provided accommodation, restaurant service and ‘beyond the norm’ attentiveness like nothing any of us had experienced (and between the group there are some very well-travelled types), delivering an event that was special and will never be forgotten.One of the main reasons that the Ritz maintains their standards are their staff and in particular in this case, our wedding coordinator. His impeccable attention to detail, his absolute unflappability in mini crisis situations, his knowledge of what is required without being asked,  his whole demeanour as he carries out his duties all reinforced the first impression as you enter the Ritz, this place is where I want to be.He and all the staff immediately brought the whole Ritz experience (and what we wanted our wedding to be) closer to us.  Patrick’s can do attitude was welcome by all guests and really did help people relax very quickly.  His attention to detail was unquestionable and he showed great skill in somehow being available at the right time (even just bumping in to him when you needed assistance) without ever crowding or making us feel claustrophobic.  The extra efforts made (upgrades / room preparation and alike) were hugely appreciated as they also went a long way to making the most perfect wedding.The staff helped to make, what would have been a very special day, just about the perfect day.

He took us back outside to the tea waiting area and left us! Fortunately the young lady looking after tea bookings saw us looking lost and advised us to take a seat at one of the reserved tables and were were to ignore the reserved signs - all credit to her. At the allocated booking we were led to our table where a waiter greeted us and after a short while our choice of tea to drink was made (about 10 available) and also would we like a glass of champagne - as it was a special occasion we said yes, the sandwiches and cakes were brought out but unfortunately they had forgotten about a special request for no chocolate our nuts but upon pointing this out the cakes were removed and returned shortly with a different selection. The sandwiches were nice but I am not sure if because we had a late afternoon booking the bread was rather dry, almost as though they had been prepared and kept open in a fridge. More sandwiches brought and then scones and an offer of two types of sliced cake.I all a pleasant experience, something we had always wanted to do but just surprised by certain staff attitudes(bar) and the standard of the sandwiches.

Our room was a great size and overall quite impressive.  We loved that even small requests were honored by the staff.  We felt welcomed and the roses on the bed were lovely.  I would encourage all to experience the Ritz London.  It is worth every penny., March 2014, Travelled as a couple
Michael O,612,172,Lunching in the grand manner,[5.0],"This was lunch at the Ritz. We have had afternoon tea on two occasions which was great and a real 'grande affaire'. The service exceptional and the sense of style perfect especially from the seats where you can observe the room. The recent refurbishment seems to mean it looks the same just fresher and still 'fin de siecle'. The staff are so cool, in control, welcoming in a totally professional way. As dining in London moves to the more casual, less formal, 'nothing special here mate apart from our marvellous zero carb tasting menu' it is wonderful to be greeted by nice people in nice uniforms who know how to serve. The lunch menu was excellent and as well presented as any restaurant in London. The sommelier was helpful, amusing, well informed - I felt he should have been an academic at Magdalen College serving the professoriat. The half bottle wine list is excellent and just ask the sommelier about the dessert wines - ours were different and extraordinary.If you want a special experience try the Dorchester - a Grande Dame of the movie industry was shown to the terrace on a wet day by a phalanx of be-suited staff.

I had a lovely cake and bottle of bubbly complimentary which was nice. We were woken by the cleaning staff in the morning, ringing our bell. A hotel such as the Ritz , world famous for afternoon tea, couldn't produce a decaffeinated tea for me. Our suitcase was badly scratched when they stored it for us and in the ritz club the man on the next table was dressed in jeans and a sweat shirt and talking on his mobile - I could have gone to Costa Coffee for that!

We booked a Jr. Suite and were given a very small room.  The hotel was full, but when I complained the manager immediately arranged to have us moved to a larger suite (I personally like room 316).  When our bags arrived a lock was missing.  The hotel manager was almost beside himself over a $10 lock!  I told him, no worries, but he insisted on having staff comb the prior room for the lock which was eventually found.  I had stayed at the hotel many times but never done high tea.  Although it was fully booked, they accommodated our last minute request and found a lovely table in the corner for us. One change for the better is that the Ritz bar no longer requires a tie.  The concierge staff has been there forever and can score you last minute tix, reservations etc as needed.  Our second room was classic Ritz- beautiful carpeting and moldings and marble bathroom per our photos.  Al always, the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.

It needs a refresher course as this antiquated snobbish behavior is outdated in our opinion. We are giving it an average as the location is excellent, it was clean and comfortable, wifi is fast and free plus a ""couple"" of the staff members were actually nice. One concierge was quite helpful while another one barely answered one of our inquiries and made it perfectly clear we were interrupting a more important phone call, unbelievable. The majority of the staff were borderline rude, far from a friendly welcoming feel for the amount of money per night, several of the servers at breakfast made a couple of our party members feel so uncomfortable they just got up and left. Another day we returned from touring and asked the 2 doormen if we could take a picture with them in front of the hotel, they turned their noses up and basically said no, for real! One of them agreed on 2nd thought, attitude adjustments are seriously needed at this hotel. Top of their game they are not, we were suppose to have a fruit basket in our room upon arrival and I had to ask for it several days later & another delivery was tardy, not the epitome of exceptional flawless service.

I love to try 'posh' things sometimes, however if you're not used to them, sometimes I feel rather uncomfortable, almost as if I'm a fraud and shouldn't be there and sometimes, the staff can be quite condescending, rude etc - Honestly, you get none of that at the Ritz, just really lovely and friendly people.We were 25 minutes early and were asked to take a seat which was fine - they found my surname on their Ipad and we got shown to the beautifully laid table. We chose the tea we would like and it came our quickly, along with some amazing sandwiches - all of which are explained by the waiter. The pastries are delicious and honestly.. you'll get so full! It doesn't look a lot on the plate and last time we made the mistake of saying 'Yes' to extra sandwiches (they come around with a massive tray of extra sandwiches so don't worry if you are hungry and want to eat more!). This time however, we saved ourselves.The scones were also amazing - served with fresh strawberry jam and cream - and then there's pudding!

We had booked in to Quillon which was near but because we had to go to another( but fantastic Montague on the Gardens) hotel we were then subject to further expense in taxis!!!!

Not wishing to waste a moment we went for a cocktail in The Rivoli Bar and asked about dining in the restaurant. The staff were very helpful and accommodating and informed us that they could fit us in which we were delighted about. After our cocktails we strolled down to the restaurant where the greeting was not friendly or welcoming, the girl with the long dark hair, was very abrupt, actually quite rude and made us feel like we were a major inconvenience!!! This made us both very feel uncomfortable. The restaurant itself was very beautiful, the waiters pleasant, however the service was so slow (is this normal?) we ordered lobster and advised it came with a fennel sauce (not mentioned on the menu description which actually said ginger and lime) I asked for no sauce as I'm not fond of fennel.  We were advised that the meal would take 40 minutes to prepare which was fine, however when it arrived it was so disappointing, the lobster was overcooked and reeked of fennel!  I honestly wished I'd complained but trying to find a waiter at this time of the night proved tricky ..... they all seemed to have vanished! After all the reviews I've read about the food at The Ritz I can honestly say I've never been so disappointed with a meal! We returned to the Rivoli Bar for another cocktail and again the welcome was great and all together a much more pleasant experience than dining in the restaurant.

With the purpose of the weekend away being a special celebration expectations where high and from the very outset the hotel delivered.The hotel is a welcome break from modern hotels. There are no clean lines, no white walls, no modern furniture and definitely no trainers. What the Ritz has though is bags of soul, character, style and panache without being stuffy. It good to see that the hotel is true to its roots. It knows what it is and it's customers like us, like that. From the very outset we were made to feel at home. The staff are very well turned out and clearly conscious that the customer is king. To the room. It was traditionally decorated and pleasantly roomy. As well as the usual features one would expect in a hotel room I was chuffed to find we had sports channels which meant I didn't have to miss out on the United match :) I also appreciated the turndown. Another nice touch.We ate in the hotel on one of the two nights during the dinner and dance evening. The food as you would expect was excellent and the music and dancing where such a change to a usual Saturday night out.We also drank in the Rivoli bar which whilst they charged hotel prices for drinks wasn't that expensive compared to other hotels I have visited before. The surroundings are lovingly maintained and art deco in style. Should have but didn't try the cocktails.  When you pay the money that these types of establishments command then you expect to feel special. You expect to be surrounded by opulence and grandeur. I am pleased to say that the Ritz delivered and I will return for those special times again.The only slight negative about the whole weekend was a power cut on the Sunday morning.

We were a party of 5 ranging from the ""Birthday Girl"" to my daughter who is only 8 (and was very exited about it!). We had a lovely time, the non tea drinkers were provided with filter coffee, and my daughter was given a choice of fruit juices or a bottle of water. She plumped for the water and felt very glamorous drinking from a stemmed glass! Sandwiches, as expected were delicious, and when offered, my daughter had some extra chicken and horseradish cream (her favourite) - although we didn't much care for the cucumber and dill, but that's personal taste.  Cakes were stunning, as were the scones.  The celebration cake we ordered was exquisite - sponge, fresh cream and fruit.  Disappointed not to get any trifle ""shots"", that one of our party had last year, but will still visit again.

spherinx,57,15,A Touch of Class!,[5.0],"My daughter and I took my mother for afternoon tea to celebrate her 90th birthday. It was a lovely experience and my mother said it was the best birthday she's ever had!  We did treat ourselves to a black cab there and back which turned out to be a godsend as our brilliant cabbie new all the back roads which meant we were on time despite the tube strike! The food is what you would expect from afternoon tea, small tasty sandwiches, scones, cakes, tea and lots of it. All very acceptable and lovely. What makes it special is the ambiance, the sheer beauty of the interior and timeless class of the place.  The staff are amazing despite the fact that they are obviously used to the vast numbers of everyday folk visiting just to say they have been, and indeed cater for them, they are not at all jaded by it and seem to get genuine pleasure from helping their customers to have a wonderful time whether it is with the excellent attentive service or the offers to take group photographs!

We returned partly because when we last stayed at the Dorchester the dress code there has really gone down market now. People wearing trainers, jeans, T shirts and shell suits in a 5 star hotel it spoils the experience and atmosphere. The Ritz on the other hand has kept up a reasonable level of dress code which keeps a special atmosphere in the Hotel with everyone dressed up a bit. I don't mean this in a snobby way. It makes you feel that the evening or afternoon tea is more special. We couldn't fault our stay, everything was perfect including all the staff.

SightseerToronto,29,56,The Ritz MADE young family endure over heated room.,[1.0],"We have yet to check out but the treatment towards our family has been so reprehensible it had to be shared in the immediate.We checked-in to room 216, on April 27th at 11am and immediately complained to Frederic the front desk agent that the room was to warm at 25C. Looking back it was a very cool day in London and there was no reason for a room to be that warm.Frederic was with us and he adjusted the thermostat to 21 and we went off to enjoy our Afternoon Tea at 11:30. After tea we went for a leisurely stroll in Green Park and returned to our room at 6pm. The room was now registering 26C hours after we left, higher than we checked-in. The engineer was called and he assured us that the problem had been resolved. Our family began our bedtime routine and the children were in their cribs asleep by 7:30pm. By 9pm our little girl woke up fussy and I was bothered that the room still felt very warm and it WAS at 28C! The engineer came a SECOND time ""fixed"" the problem and brought a huge LOUD fan to lull my already fussy child to sleep.It didn't help and the temperature stayed at 28C the entire night and by this time we were too exhausted to call on the engineer or management to make things better.This morning WE called on-duty Manager, Judith, to visit our room to personally experience just how uncomfortable a stuffy 28C feels. Unfortunately the terrible customer service continued with excuses and no solutions. We were told there was a power outage in our particular location and for that reason it was not their fault.The problem is that the engineer told us about the power outage YESTERDAY afternoon and assured us that the problem had been resolved the first visit. By the second engineer visit at 9pm at 28C it was very clear that the A/C was not working and management still felt it was acceptable for a family with two small children, 2 and 18 months to sleep in 28C.Keep in mind WE had to reach out management and Judith never once offered a complimentary night stay or anything else for that matter. It was only after we called her and complained at length that she felt a discount of 50% was the best they could do.April 27th we were celebrated a birthday with an Afternoon Tea in what we hoped would was the epitome of London service. It turns our that management willingly allowed a young family to stay in a room with a non functional A/C in temperatures of 28C and that's the best they could do.", April 2014, Travelled with family

The hotel is wonderfully atmospheric – it’s like stepping back in time into a golden age of glitz and glamour. The room was bright and beautiful. The staff were friendly and the service excellent. We ordered a bottle of champagne, and it came along with a special surprise – a birthday cake for myself – as well as a birthday card artfully written in perfect Welsh! We were also given a large chocolate easter egg free of charge. We had a pre-theatre meal, and the food was amongst the best I’ve ever tasted. Utterly sublime. The only negative I can think of was the plumbing in the rooms. We were woken at 6.30am on Sunday by a noise like the Red Sea crashing down on top of us, and then a prolonged shriek as if a few wayward Egyptians had been caught up in the maelstrom. It was clear that someone in the bathroom next to ours was having an early morning shower, but never have I heard such noisy plumbing. Luckily the only other gushing came from ourselves as we discussed how wonderful the hotel was.

They genuinely seemed concerned that we should have the best experience possible, were courteous and friendly without appearing inauthentic.Our room fronted the main road but was quiet and afforded a great night's sleep-a truly comfortable bed, lovely ensuite and the welcome basket was a real treat-heaps of fresh and dried fruits and a bottle of bubbly!The dining room was a delight in itself and Darling and I spent a wonderful evening people watching whilst being served by gracious and welcoming staff.The food and drinks were superb, and the quality of the experience was repeated the next morning at breakfast.I think if I had to sum our our stay at the Ritz it would be ""restorative"".

ittessot,479,52,"Cesar Himself Would be Proud, Still!",[5.0],"From the very beginning of booking our room nine months in advance, we received trademark service from the team at The Ritz London.  Between the pre-arrival experience and the reviews on Trip Adviser, I had very high expectations.  These expectations clearly met and exceeded.  Before I go any further, allow me to describe myself.  I am thirty, very young for this hotel.  Given some reviews on here about being mistreated by the staff, my partner and I were worried about being young and also gay at such a discriminating hotel.  Let me tell you, this hotel goes so far to please and make you feel welcome, I have to believe that the people writing these terrible reviews are either tourists not staying at the hotel, liars, or deserved snippy service!My grumbles aside, this hotel is perfect in every way.  We came from Dallas and arrived in the city many hours before check-in.  Since we were upgraded, the room took a while to get ready, so we walked the city and came back around 2:00PM.  Our room was still not ready, so the hotel seated us in The Long Gallery for a complimentary afternoon tea seating!  I've heard of people waiting for months to have tea here and the hotel gave us this experience without asking.  A fabulous first impression, as was my Leaders Club Gift and birthday cake in the room.We arrived in the room and it was a corner deluxe on the 4th floor over Piccadilly and Arlington.  Our view was straight down Piccadilly, amazing!  The room was very large and featured gorgeous lighting, original artwork from 1911, a dressing area, desk, sitting area and dining nook, with two closets, and everything was dripping in gold leaf!  Just spectacular.  The bathroom was a little small, but was covered in marble and featured Asprey amenities to die for!  Both the room and bathroom featured fresh flowers.  Orchids in the room and roses in the bathroom.During the whole stay, the entire staff was fantastic.  The housekeeping staff was so sweet and kind, and we were even home to see the famous Ritz turn-down take place and the maid was so kind chatting us up while she worked.  Breakfast in the immaculate dining room was a treat to start the day, and waiters in their tuxes were just so put together and adorable.  And where do I begin with the concierge team and lobby staff.  They recognize you and call you by name within your fist afternoon there, wow.Two nights we went down to the exclusive and private Ritz Club for cocktails and dinner.  This club might be the most immaculate and ornate of any hotel bar and dining room I've seen.  One of the casino rooms is even an amber room replica.  If you've got a suite jacket with you, don't miss the Ritz Club, it's the finest hotel bar and casino the world over.All in all, this was a perfect stay.

StandsWithFist,113,30,The Ritz:  What a Luxury Hotel Aspires To Be,[5.0],"Let me first admit:  I am not the type, or wealthy enough, to casually book 4 night stays in top-of-the-top type hotels when travelling on my own dime.   I was looking for nicer hotels in London, and worked to see where I could get a good enough deal to persuade myself to make the reservation.   I was lucky enough to find a good ""pay upon booking"" type rate for the Ritz, and so I booked it.Prior to arriving in London, I arranged (by email, because of the time difference to the US) to express preferences for room location---i.e., Green Park, upper floor, etc.   When we arrived, the excellent staff whisked off our luggage and checked us in.  The room wasn't ready (we arrived in early PM), through some mistake, and so we were upgraded to a suite on Piccadilly.  The room was wonderful---beautifully furnished, every amenity, great marble bathroom with shower and separate, full sized/old fashioned tub, dual sinks.  The room was quiet and peaceful---at the end of a short hallway.  Never heard any hall noise, and never heard street noise.   The turndown service is well done, with slippers etc.   Feels like you have a butler.I would strongly advise room service breakfast for the morning after you arrive (if coming from the States).  The Ritz does room service like it should be done---a wheeled table is brought in, tablecloth and settings arranged, perfectly steeped tea or brewed coffee, everything hot, and ""cozies"" (like a blanket, for keeping things warm) on not just the tea but the toast as well.  I felt like applauding.The afternoon tea is something to enjoy if you can swing it.  They keep some reservations for guest, but ask them in advance for this.  Service is sterling, in and out.  You leave your key (an old fashion, brass key) with the front desk as you come and go.  Part of the magic of the Ritz is that there are rules (dress codes, conduct) and they are simple to obey.   Dress nicely.  Coat is required in some areas.  The Rivoli Bar is perhaps the best hotel bar to which I've ever been.  The cocktail selection is superb, and nicely crafted.  I look forward to returning to this gem of a hotel.", August 2013, Travelled with family
nsbeach1,72,26,Putting On the Ritz,[5.0],"The Ritz-what can one say about this amazing Hotel. Everything is over-the-top.

When the staff found out it was my birthday, I was pleasantly surprised to find a hand written card and a box of chocolates in our suite. The decor and amenities are spectacular and the restoration is simply beautiful. The Concierge team are the best. We did notice that when taking a warm shower in the morning the water temperature would sometimes vary dramatically sometimes projecting very cold streams which would most certainly wake one up. About the only suggestion , I would make is that , morning coffee or tea upon request, really should be complimentary in the suites instead of 18.00 GBP for two.

Lovely bathroom in keeping with the age and ambience of the hotel.When I checked in they asked what time we would like the turndown service in the evenings, that was a nice touch. Why then did the second night they completely ignore my ""after 8pm so we will have gone out"" and turn up at 6pm? We had just got in and it wasn't convenient at that time.  She didn't offer to come back later. I had booked a twin room for two people, I arrived first and went out leaving the key at reception. I texted my companion to tell her the room number in case she arrived before I returned. She did but was refused access to the room on the grounds that I hadn't left instructions to give the key to any one else. Yet they knew I'd booked for two people and she knew the room number we had been assigned. They were neither apologetic nor proactive (they had my mobile number, they could had called and asked me). They didn't try to make my friend comfortable, offer her a drink or even show her to a seat to wait. I thought part of the reason one pays over £300pn room only, is for the service! The final niggle was that there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room. Ive stayed in 6 star hotels and 0 star hotels and they always have this.  What can be the reason behind this? Surely not because the Ritz needs the £6 per cup (plus £5 room service charge) that it costs through room service. I'd be interested to know why it's not provided if the manager reads this.In summary I think that if you stay here you are paying for position and reputation and that's the reason the price is high.", March 2014, Travelled with friends

Being French, a French spoken gentleman stepped in straight away for the check in.The building is beautiful, the rooms spacious and distinctively decorated with class and elegance. We were a bit disappointed by the bathroom size in comparison with the vast bedroom. A detail. After we were showed our room, the room service brought us a beautiful table with birthday cake, fresh fruits and Champagne... It was fabulous! We used the room service at dinner time . The food and the service was irreproachable. We both slept like babies in our extremely comfortable  beds. Breakfast was delightful. The restaurant was to us the soul of the establishment: sophisticated, calm, inviting, delicate, elegant.. Everything was perfect to our eyes. The slight disappointment came in the afternoon when we had the famous afternoon tea. The Palm Court is a gorgeous room. However we didn't enjoy being crammed in what was more like a noisy hens house than an elegant  environment. The place is so full that you can't barely enjoy the piano or have a conversation without rising your voice. The cakes are Devine, the service is  good and courteous.The sandwiches have nothing exceptional or different. The tea menu is quite impressive. To my opinion, the Ritz experience is fantastic.

Toiletries are unremarkable, and what is usually provided as standard for most five-star hotel amenities (dental kits, shaving kits, sewing kits, etc.) were unavailable in-room and I had to call housekeeping to specifically request it. Valet and porter services were excellent and personable, front desk and reception was blasé, perfunctory and robotic - they may as well offer automated check-in kiosks as the difference would be mimimal, housekeeping was bizarre (cleaned the room but left behind an empty plate, folded napkin and a butter knife from our morning's room service atop the fireplace mantle - why?!, misspelled my name to the point of confusion with dry cleaning). One good thing with the hotel is security and privacy - they make a vested effort in ensuring the lobby isn't congested with non-guests and camera-toting sightseers, though you may become wary of having to confirm your room number and name with the latest security detail on the floor.I took my partner here as I had a decent enough visit my first time years back, but for this second visit it was insanely disappointing and underwhelming for the both of us - especially for his first impression.

I wasn't expecting to look out onto Green Park, but this was the worst view I have ever had in a hotel!Having placed a special request for ""plain sandwiches"" more than 48 hours in advance of our afternoon tea, it would have been nice if this request had been met.  I asked for some plain cheese, chicken and ham sandwiches to be served to one of my guests.  My waiter insisted that the request had been met, however this was not the case and my guest could not eat the sandwiches.More information should be provided, preferably in the room, about breakfast times, check out times, use of the club etc.Just a small thing, but our request for toast at breakfast was forgotten about.

The welcome and the ambience was fabulous, we had opted for Champagne which was beautiful, chilled and set the afternoon in swing being a favourite of my mothers! The sandwiches, scones and cakes were lovely with a good choice of teas. What I was particularly struck by was the service. I had wondered if it might be a 'tourist trap' experience with waiters with a 'here we go again' attitude but none of it. They made my mother's occasion very special and when her birthday cake came out complete with candle, the piano played 'happy birthday' and every one in The Ritz sang 'happy birthday' making it a truly memorable occasion for her and for us.

Had an absolutely fantastic time.  Staff are extremely friendly and accommodating, attending to your every need.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.  Sandwiches are replenished frequently and all taste gorgeous. Scones came out warm with lovely jam and clotted cream but by the time we got to our Pastries, which again were very tasteful, we were quite full up, but apparently unable to take them home in a box - which I think should be allowed, or do they serve them up again to the next customer?????.  Tried different Teas and again the waiters were extremely helpful in helping me choose.  Refills of pots of tea again frequent.

As soon as I arrived at the hotel (Monday 3rd March, 2014), I was taken care of and I received such courteousness and personal attention, I hadn't anticipated this at all.I was shown to my room and offered, at a surcharge - a more luxurious room which I eventually decided upon.The rooms are luxurious and exceptionally clean with every amenity catered for their guests.  The bedrooms are sumptuously decorated in a style befitting a bygone era, a time when old world charm and refinements were the norm. The bathroom, shower and toilet fittings are a ritzy gold and there are plenty of warm towels on the heated towel rail (much appreciated by me) and ample amounts of toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, stationery, spare blankets and notepads with pencils by the bedsides.A very welcome tray of fruit and home-made shortbread plus coffee and tea PLUS the all-important kettle was brought to my room and refreshed everyday.  The room key is an old-fashioned yale-lock on a chunky royal blue and gold key ring which, should you happen to forget to post at concierge on your daily outing, would grace any table, if you, *ahem*, nonchalantly removed it from your pocket!Nothing was too much trouble from the staff at The Ritz.  There was always a friendly greeting from all the staff at the hotel and on checking out, I had the services of the ever-charming Sachin who was most helpful.  Benjamin and John at Reception looked after me on my arrival and Sheila looked after me at my departure.

I don't think the Ritz can easily be bettered, maybe because it really is in a class of its own, other hotels don't do things this way anymore, they have all fallen prey to modernization and, ok, they often do it very well, but the Ritz feels like it has never changed and you somehow feel transported back to a golden age.", February 2014, Travelled on business

Why is this, is it may be the individuals have unrealistic expectations or is it that the place they are reviewing decide to pick on them? Anyway, based on my limited experience of The Ritz, I cannot see how anyone could give anything other than a 5 star review. Okay, it costs a fortune but you know that from the start and that's part of what makes it so special.My experience started with the doorman addressing me by name even though we hadn't checked in. He took our luggage and a second person escorted us to the reception where we had been upgraded from our booked King room to a suite. What a start! We had room 106 which is in the corner of the building just over the reception area. The room furniture was not at all tatty but was exactly what one would expect from the hotel, clean, opulent and without a scratch in sight. The staff who showed us the room did not hang around for a tip, quickly leaving and allowing us to settle in. We had booked lunch on the first day and visited the main restaurant. The staff were excellent, happy to describe the menu choices and make recommendations. We selected the 3 course lunch at £49 which was excellent value. Our only other visit to the restaurant was for breakfast each day. We had selected an inclusive tariff which gives a saving on the regular full English price of £36. Food quality was as expected and again the staff were brilliant. So, don't be put off by any bad reviews. A stay at The Ritz is something that should be on everyone's bucket list.

We had a Superior King room and it was very comfortable..the turn down service included lowering the blackout blinds which we hadn't realised were there, and we slept so well we almost missed breakfast which finished at 11.

I even ordered off menu.Just fill dining table was set up for the meal!A nice surprise of hearts made from rose petals on our bed and the most fabulous Turn Down service I have ever seen.Breakfast was an equally magical experience in our room.Lunch to round it all off was beautiful and impeccable service and quality.- Once in a lifetime maybe.- Memory's for a lifetime definitely.- Worth every penny oh yeah.Spend 24 hours there lapping up everything - oh and more 'Ritz' memorabilia than anywhere else (even the tissues are logo'ed)Nick and Marky", February 2014, Travelled with friends

With cream, gold and mirror décor, towering palms and impeccably dressed waiters, it was reminiscent of a scene from the titanic especially when the quartet started to play!  The tea was courteously served with a good selection of sandwiches, scones, small cakes and then on top of that, a trolley was wheeled round with yet more cakes.  We had the coffee but contrary to another post, found it very acceptable, strong, good flavour, better than most cafetiere grounds.  If you drink instant then it may be a little strong for you.

We booked a nice suite for us plus our daughter for about 900,-Considering the shopping plans of my two girls we tried to get a late check out, which is not that easy. A charming receptionist encouraged us to double the price for the Berkely Suite with a high potential for a late check out.First of all, the hotel is a museum of finest British hospitality and perfection in service, each staff member is attentive and nice.The next day, after enjoying a superior breakfast we left for shopping, considering the promised late check out at 4pm. At 12:20 the hotel called me to tell me, that I should obey the check out time at 12:30 (???). After some discussions we had to head back to the hotel without completing our shopping tour to clear the room, no time to eat the nice birthday cake and to open the champagne. If she would have called me in the morning, it would not have been a problem to reschedule the day, but there was no earlier call...Discussions with the manager Judith did not lead to any solutions and she also did not come up with suggestions, compensations, she just manifest her point of view, check out agreements are without guarantee.It has been the job of hotel employees of Ritz who found some solutions for us, because they just don't work there, this hotel is their life.The manager however is a total fail and that explains the three stars only. Never accept an upgrade deal in exchange of late check out, the form you complete at check in with the desired check out time has no meaning.First 12 hours amazing, second 12 hours a disappointment followed by employees of the hotel, some of them working there since 20 years, who kept me for giving only two stars.Judith however should think over, if she really works in the right hotel....", February 2014,nan

Our cocktails were amazing works of art in fact. it was whilst we were enjoying them that we noticed a scrum like gathering outside the palm      court restaurant at no point did ant member of staff approach us an tell us that out table was ready or offer to take out drinks for us so we had no choice but to gather our drinks and join the scrum not the fine dining experience that I had hoped for! We were seated and our afternoon tea selection was brought to us three of our party opted for tea and were happy with it but myself and the birthday girl opted for coffee it was vile and undrinkable another disappointment!

On a wet and miserable wet afternoon,  I must have waited a whole 30 seconds before receiving a welcoming smile and an apology for having been kept waiting (in contrast to twiddling my thumbs for 10 minutes or so in a similarly 5*, but more trendy establishment within the square mile).The room was spacious with a good size bathroom, 'proper' towels (and enough of them for even my requirements) with quality toiletries. Naturally all the usual little extras were there but just that much better.  Our top floor room overlooked Green Park and a number of some of the more iconic landmarks of London's skyline;  Big Ben, Battersea Power Station, the London Eye.The public areas cannot be faulted and I defy anyone not to have a glass of champagne or a cocktail before heading out for dinner.The cost of a room is somewhat higher than I would usually pay when booking an overnght stay after a dinner in London but I have been converted by the excellence of the Ritz and will most definitely return.", February 2014, Travelled as a couple

Staying at the Ritz isn't just a stay, it's an experience.  Despite it's opulence, attention to detail and warm and friendly service is clearly the theme that runs throughout and is well evidenced by all staff.  No way is this a hotel living off it's reputation.  It works hard to maintain its reputation and exceeded my expectations which were already high when we arrived.  Even the noise of flag outside our room being swept about vigorously by high winds didn't deter from an excellent nights sleep.  The sirens of emergency service vehicles did wake me a couple of times but the Hotel can't be held responsible for that.  We thoroughly enjoyed dinner in the evening in the restaurant thanks to some wonderful entertainment from the band and the Ritz dancers and exceptional service from David - Thank You.

The accomodations are as lavish as the public rooms downstairs, marble bahrooms, and Renaissance(esque) decor for which The Ritz is reknown.

Instead of having to wait around in the lobby, which is the case in most hotels, we were taken to the Rivioli bar by an extremely charming member of staff. Not only that, we were given tea, olives and nuts on the house. That's what you call ""the extra touches"". Once our rooms was ready, 20 minutes earlier than check in time, we were taken to our Junior Suite which took our breath away. It took me about half an hour to take in the sheer beauty and ambience of the room. The staff had already taken into consideration that it was mothers birthday and on the bed lay a neatly rapped present. It was a neat set of accessories which probably cost around 100 pounds. After we had settled in, we decided to order a few drinks. The charming butler delivered our drinks as well as a delectable cake for my Mother. We were left speechless.

At 3am (after some fun in the Ritz Club) this is a facility I seriously missed. However, I was very grateful for the bottle of water and complimentary biscuits thoughtfully provided by the bed. I could not find a hair dryer. I wished there was a room freshener in the bathroom (nuff said). The bathrobe was a bit too small for me (size 22). Everything else was amazing.

This isn't true as the biggest frontage is on Piccadilly, a busy, lively street with great cafes and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art just up the road.  Our room did overlook Green Park (gorgeous view) but most don't. The toiletries are Asprey; the jewellers to the Crown - one of the few brands you actually want to use.

Bought a bath towel and a hand towel for £ 50.00.The Rivoli Bar was a lot smaller than expected but very welcoming and the staff was excellent. Beware of the non-alcoholic cocktails at £ 10 each which are in fact mainly crushed ice....Afternoon tea was delightful, and plentiful. Breakfast was probably not the best I have ever seen but it was certainly plentiful and delicious, beautifully presented and served in the most magnificent room. Very unpretentious also, which may come as a surprise.The place is welcoming, gives you a taste of a bygone age whilst keeping up with the modern world.

Simon B,44,12,Decadence personified!,[5.0],"We dined at the ritz for afternoon tea to celebrate my 2nd year anniversary. It was wonderful and experience I shall not forget. The sandwiches were stunning and out of the 5 choices I found the cucumber, cream cheese, dill,chives on caraway seed bread was to be our favourite. I was worried that we would only get the 10 finger sandwiches on the stand but was pleased they provided us with more.The scones were perfect, they were soft, sweet with just a little saltiness. The cakes were also very good, only 4 choices but still great. Also the two cakes of the day was given a choice of raspberry cake or lemon drizzle were great, the raspberry my personal favourite with a shortbread base, raspberry jam, pistachio sponge, whipped cream and of course raspberry's. All of this all on bone chine or beautiful silver, the room itself -as well as the rest of the hotel- screamed decadence. We shall be returning and bringing friends.", January 2014, Travelled as a couple

TjSanghera123,26,8,"Lunch, stay, breakfast",[4.0],"Me and my husband stayed at the Ritz weekend 4th jan 14. At first impressions it's actually quite small inside, they use lots of mirrors to give the illusion of space. Once we checked in we were escorted to our pre booked lunch. Whilst walking through the area it seemed quite busy with lots of people taking photographs. The busiest area was the middle section where afternoon tea was serverd (palm court) We entered the main dining room and were escorted to to our table . We were greeted with a set menu and a glass of champagne. Lovely as The Ritz is i found the decor very dated but in a nice way however the set menu was not vegitarian frendily at all. The service was attentive however I found that it abit too much, feeling that we didn't really get any time alone. The food was lovely but we found we asked for more bread just to 'fill us up' at bit more. The set menu is a bit limited on choice. Once lunch was finished we checked into our room, the room was big enough but very dated this time not in a nice way. The mini bar wouldn't open with the key however we though that was a blessing after looking at the mini bar price list ....a small bottle of Evan was £7 !!! The air con was very noisy, the cold tap in the bathroom sink had no water coming out of it at all , we did call the porter to inform them and we were told an engineer would be sent.....no one ever turned up ! This made it very difficult for my husband to shave and for both of us to brush our teeth as only very hot water was working. The shower was very powerful for the bath area and water seemed to go everywhere.  The bed was ok but I was expecting it to be more comfortable after all it was the ritz !  The bar downstairs is quite small and prices are high ....beer £10 cocktails starting from £19 to £350 !!! But they do give you olives and nuts which is plentyfull. Breakfast was ok, I have seen better buffets. The full English is cooked to your specifications which is nice. To be honest breakfast was the nicest part to see the beauty of the hotel as the hotel was empty ...however at 11am. It soon started filling up. The nicest part was coming back after an evening out to find that they room had been cleaned and turned down , we were not expecting that and it was nice to come back to a clean room with slippers laid out too ! The staff were friendly and the hotel was nice however the prices are very high in comparison to other hotels in the area ,", January 2014, Travelled as a couple

Champagne and cocktails in bar before dinner where every guest has such  personal attention and the food is enhanced by the sheer theatre of the service. The restaurant had a incredible dancing couple putting on a show of tango and salsa that had us all up trying our hardest to imitate - apologies now to the other guests who actually could dance and may have been trampled on due to our exuberance. We sampled the refined cigar shop which is situated in the garden and sang Christmas carols until everyone else left and finally at 4am we too crept to bed with the night porters help....As always breakfast was delightful and the staff discreet when it came to ordering bloody marys for medicinal reasons only.

What can I say...the experience was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. We stayed in one of the junior suites which was absolute luxury at its best. The pictures on the website do not do the room justice at all. At the suite we met with Luis. He was an absolute delight and nothing was too much trouble for him. He had some really great stories to tell us about the history hotel and we want to give a personal thanks for everything he did for us.The children received gifts upon our arrival which they were extremely happy with. The gifts included a Ritz Teddy Bear, a manicure set and also a traditional wooden jigsaw.I had an appointment at The Ritz Salon and that experience was also fantastic, having my hair done by a celebrity stylist! Any woman who wants a bit of pampering has to visit the salon and treat themselves to a glass of champagne whilst having their treatment.We had booked in for afternoon tea and this is an experience in itself. The sandwiches and cakes were absolutely divine and the plates are constantly refilled. Do not eat anything before going for afternoon tea!! The Christmas choir performed beautifully and made the whole experience even more magical.In the evening me and my husband went into the Rivoli Bar which again, what can I say...delightful! The cocktails are amazing as is the champagne and caviar. The service is absolutely tremendous.We then went into the Ritz Club and Casino. Another fantastic experience and I would like to say a big thank you to Clive and Laura for making our evening so pleasurable.Room service is a must. The service and food is impeccable!I stay in many hotels around the world and I have to say that The Ritz is most definitely number one and is luxury at its absolute best.

The staff is gracious and charming in a way no American hotel can match; they just know how to behave. The public rooms are just magnificent. It is a shame that some reviewers do not like the standards of dress in the hotel. We find it a pleasure to dress well among others who also dress like adults. It adds to the over-all aura of luxury and grandeur. Why do some reviewers think every place must cater to the lowest common denominator?

Dawny7890,384,30,Wonderful Stay and Met All Expectations,[5.0],"My husband and I used The Ritz London as a base to visit the sites and attractions of London, and we loved our stay.  Our room was beautifully decorated with all items and equipment in good condition and working order.  Bed extremely comfortable and turn down service available.  There was lots of clothing and storing space.  Room has two lounge type chairs so we could both sit in comfort when relaxing.  This is important to me, as I really hate when you book a room for two but only have one chair (in other hotels).  Our room looked out right down the street so it was nice to see what was happening around (rather than having windows that face another building).There is also a desk with a chair which matched the furniture and in good condition.  The bathroom was well decorated and all fixtures and fittings in good condition.  The shower had really good pressure and heat.  There were complimentary robes in the bathroom, and the towels were good quality.  The under floor heating in the bathroom really kept the chill out (we were staying in December).  In fact the heater/coolers in the room made it very easy to keep a comfortable temperature.  Customer Service is excellent as you would expect.  As a smoker in a non-smoking room I had to stand on the street by the entrance when I wanted to smoke which can be a little intimidating when alone, but the hotel doormen would pop their head around the corner just to check I was ok.  It was lovely to come in and out of the hotel as all staff would offer f greeting and welcome us back if we had gone out.  With the key and key fob being heavy it was nice to be able to leave the key with reception on leaving and collect it when we had returned from our visits.  The only issue I did have was that our room was near the (air duct, air con, heater??) pipes and they were a little noisy at night.  I did mention this to reception who said they would ask maintenance to have a look at it, although nothing was fed back to us during our stay.  However, this was a minor issue and it may have been because I wasn't used to it. Overall a wonderful stay and met all our expectations.  Customer service excellent, staff very friendly but always very keen and enthusiastic in a professional sense, room lovely, food excellent.

We were introduced to Sebastian, our butler, who escorted us to our room (Sebastian deserves a special mention-what a wonderful chap he is!). We probably looked like a couple of scruffy oiks after our journey, and were treated with nothing but warmth and welcome.The room was wonderful, so comfortable and well appointed, the bed was the most sumptious I have ever slept on. We had a snooze, refreshed our spirits with long, hot showers and made our way to the dining room. Dinner was a delight-each of the 4 courses delivering beautiful flavours and satisfaction and we marvelled at the skill of the waiting staff-it was like watching a ballet.After a blissful, restorative night we enjoyed  similarly scrumptious breakfast and made our way into the rest  of our holiday.We both enjoyed our stay so much, and Darling (for whom this was the first UK visit) commented that people complaining that Londoners are unfriendly clearly haven't stayed at the Ritz!

When I called for a shoe shine or turn down service, the staff would be at our door within minutes. Michael the doorman was very friendly and remembered our name every day.Some people don't like the tight security, but I appreciated it and felt very safe.  Hotel security was posted around the lobby at all hours.  There were extra men on duty in the evening.I appreciated the dress code. Jeans are not permitted in certain areas of the hotel.  Guests look elegant and sophisticated.  There is an air of respectability and Old World glamour.  I loved it!We had two rooms because we brought our teenagers with us.  Both rooms were stocked with lots of fluffy white towels.  We had complimentary bottled water and ice every night.  The sheets and pillows were soft.  Mattress was comfortable.It is quite expensive to eat at the hotel.  The waiters in the main restaurant were very snobby during lunch and dinner.  They tried on numerous occasions to up-charge us and I felt the language barriers and accents would increase during these moments. If we didn't consent to the more expensive bottle of wine, for example, then the waiter/sommelier would get huffy and irritated. He didn't seem satisfied when we ordered the $300 bottle of wine!  That was after he gave a glowing report on a $3,000 vintage, and then the $700 vintage.  Nevertheless, there are plenty of restaurants nearby if you want to avoid the persnickety waiters in the main restaurant.  However, the breakfast staff was very nice.  In addition, Rivoli Bar staff was nice.The room rate was reasonable for the amenities and service provided.  The hotel was spectacularly decorated for Christmas.  We had tea and there was a never ending supply of food.Hotel guests can dine at The Ritz Club casino.  You can't gamble, but the bar is phenomenal. The only negative was that the shower sprayed water all over the floor.  This happened in both rooms because the glass shower door provided inadequate coverage.  The water damage made the paint peal off the walls.Overall, I'd definitely stay at this hotel again.", December 2013, Travelled with family

The surroundings are elegant and perfectly maintained, the food and drink of the highest quality, and the service is impeccable. I don't know of a better  concierge desk, for instance: they have always managed whatever I've needed.The rooms are as luxurious as you'd imagine in a hotel that defines luxury. They're spacious and well appointed, generally with a sitting area, and the beds and pillows are comfortingly inviting. Our bathroom this stay was very large, and had a tub that filled instantly, and a separate marble shower.We entertained some friends in the Rivoli Bar with some excellent cocktails- I am especially fond of the Vesper, though the house champagne goes down well, too. The Rivoli is just right: classic Art Deco decoration, an intimate bar area, and tables that never seem over-filled. It spills over into the main gallery as well, and the people watching there is almost an Olympic sport.I agree with the old saying that the Ritz has the 'most beautiful dining room in Europe.' To match it, they also have a great team of waiters, who understand and deliver five-star service. The chef, John Williams, is deservedly decorated for the magic he performs in the kitchen, and Luigi looks after us as if we're the only table in the room. I'm sure he'll treat you the same way, too.This luxury and attention come with a price, and the Ritz is not afraid to charge for it, but for those times you feel like splurging it is good value.

TravelAlotLeics,3,4,Disappointing,[3.0],"Whilst staying in London with a friend for a week I wondered if it were possible to visit The Ritz simply to experience the ambience and have a cup of tea. I duly rang the hotel beforehand to check if this was possible and was assured that I would be welcome to use the hotel bar anytime. On visiting the hotel this afternoon therefore,I was disappointed to find that,not only was the service by one member of the Rivoli bar very brusque but also discourteous and I was made to feel both unwelcome and almost second class.  To be fair to other members of staff (a lovely receptionist who showed me to the bar personally and a second waiter who saved the  day when his colleague had been discourteous) my visit,and subsequent impression of the hotel would have been enjoyable,had it not been for the unacceptable behaviour of the member of staff in question. When I asked if I could just have a drink on my arrival at the bar the waiter initially seemed almost dismissive of my request and said he would have to ""find out if this was possible"". He then escorted me into the Rivoli bar and showed me to a small table which was tucked behind a pillar. When I asked if I could sit in the main lounge area so that I could seed and hear the Carol singers, he replied with a rude ""no!""I then had to wait a good 5 minutes before being served,when I ordered a pot of Earl Grey. Another waiter then came and asked me if I would prefer to sit in the lounge as he had obviously seen and heard the conversation with his colleague.  He not only showed me politely to a seat in the lounge but also employed me to enjoy the call singers.  I was then left waiting for 15 minutes with no sign of my tea,despite other customers who arrived after me being served first.  I eventually had to approach the first(discourteous) waiter myself,asking him where my order was,to which he replied:""it's coming!""very brusquely and not giving me any eye contact.I felt totally humiliated;not an emotion I we expected to experience on a visit to a five star,iconic hotel!It is unacceptable and indeed a shame, that the behaviour of one,ill- mannered member of staff should sully what should have been an erstwhile memorableexperience,especially as I was hoping to recommend the hotel for a family party.  I certainly won't be doing this now.", December 2013,nan
spencerusa,507,330,"Some Highs, Some Lows",[4.0],"The distinctive advantage of the Ritz is location. You can walk twenty minutes east to Covent Garden and the theatre district and twenty minutes west to Harrods and Knightsbridge. AOr you can quickly access Green Park and walk south through St. James's Park to Westminster. Only the Stafford (traditional boutique hotel) and Meridien Piccadilly are as well located.THe ambience is one of traditional luxury, lots of gilt edged mirrors, pink and green pastel carpets and wallpaper, furnititure styled after French antiques. Most of the uniformed wait staff in the restaurants are French. There is an air of formality about the Ritz; if you are not well-dressed in the public areas of the hotel, you will not be (made to) feel comfortable.Room rates at the Ritz are high. They are well-equipped in a traditional manner, spotless and always with fresh paint. Our inside room on this occasion only had a single small window with no view. However, it was very quiet. The bedrooms that overlook Piccadilly can be noisy. The only problem with the room was the shower which was doubled with an unusually narrow bath tub. It's difficult for old hotels to redesign bathrooms to modern standards but, given the room rate, it was annoying to be taking a shower in conditions akin to a Holiday Inn.A few tips on wining and dining. The Rivoli bar, tucked away behind the lobby, is  very cozy, art deco in style and offers bar food. If you can stromach paying 19 pounds for a glass of champagne and 26 pounds for a crab club sandwich (almost devoid of crab), you will enjoy this place. My advice, go there just to have a coffee and enjoy the atmosphere. one good menu item is the curate's platter, a plate of English ham, pates and cheeses; as a snack, one serving is enough for two people.The main restaurant is in the style of a grand salon with high ceilings and decor to match. A full breakfast costs 36 pounds and frankly is nothing special. In fact, the fruit and cereal choices are very limited. Our omelette was overcooked and had to be sent back. My suggestion is go to Starbucks for breakfast and come back for lunch by when the chef has arrived. You can enjioy a three course set lunch for 49 pounds which is ten times better than the breakfast. In fact the exotic fruit souffle with rum and banana ice cream was one of the best desserts I have enjoyed all year.Upon early morning checkin, our room was not available though we had booked it for the prior night. This is an old scam of double selling the same room. A couple of pointed remarks and we were accommodated quickly after being placed in a holding room for half an hour. Partly as a result, we were able to check out at 4pm a couple of days later.The only other service snafu related to housekeeping. Their prioriy is to make up the rooms of departing guests, not those who are staying on. We returned one afternoon to find our bedroom still not serviced. Before you go out, call housekeeping to give them a prompt to service your room. The sign you can hang on your door knob appears to have no impact.", December 2013, Travelled as a couple

The Ritz is beautifully decorated with a huge tree in reception and lovely smaller trees throughout the hotel. The tea was excellent with champagne and carol singers to accompany it. The only thing that stops this being a 5 star review is the fact that the hotel doesn't provide 'doggy bags' for those of you (and that was most tables the night we were there) who just can't finish the impressive amount of food they provide!

As a history student the building was a great experience, like going back in time. From the moment we arrived the service was fabulous, our suitcase was taken from the car and delivered to our rooms very promptly. Check in was swift and then we were accompanied to our room. We opted for a King Size room. The rooms were nicely appointed and the bathrooms spacious, with shower gel, etc, which was nice and saved me from having to buy some, which I forgot to pack. The interior of the hotel was beautiful classic luxury which is complemented by the excellent service received. The concierge (x3) was very helpful and booked us tables and theatre tickets with ease. Every attention to detail is catered for and if you can dine at the restaurant, the food was some of the best I've tasted (go for the lamb was amazing). I have never dined in such a beautiful room, the surroundings in the restaurant are wonderful and the service we received was very attentive. The staff were kind and polite and knew exactly what to do. A special thanks to Roberto and Christian for their great service on both nights. We also sampled afternoon tea in the palm court, the sandwiches were good quality and the selection of tea was very elaborate, it's a good experience so try it.  Security in the building was nice to see and we felt safe knowing the entrance was watched. If you're staying in London there is no better place, choose the Ritz you will not be disappointed, we will definitely be returning when we visit London. Only disappointment was the spa was under renovation and we could not use it :(. And the dress code should be more strictly implemented regarding women as some at the palm court were not dressed to the standard the men had to adhere to (to put it nicely).

Room size at The Ritz is always a plus as even their Queen is bigger than many King rooms in London. We were upgraded to a King room because we had to check in one night before our original reservation and they had no Queen available.

Susan C,156,66,Luxury Treat,[5.0],We stayed at The Ritz for one night after we had dinner on the Orient Express. It was beyond fabulous. The décor was superb and very opulent. The staff were absolutely charming and attentive. Our room was vast and very luxurious with the biggest bed I have ever slept in. The in house video says it is the best hotel in the world and I would not disagree. The underground casino was beyond belief with its fabulous chandeliers and extravagant furniture. I couldn't find anything to complain about and I tried. All in all a wonderful experience. What a treat., October 2013, Travelled as a couple

The rooms are beautiful and you feel wonderful the moment you walk thru the door.  After tea, the mist cleared and the sun came out.  We walked thru the park and headed to Buckingham Palace.  No crowd so we walked around and enjoyed our stroll.  We would have loved to stay longer but were on our way back home early the next morning.  We had a lovely overnight at the Ritz.", October 2013, Travelled as a couple
jbreda,23,17,Nice but not perfect,[4.0],"Stayed for 1 night in October 2013, in conjunction with a theatre.  As many others have mentioned, the hotel is very well placed and very elegant with excellent staff and facilities.  However, there are a few issues that we experienced that deserve mentioning.  First we were welcomed to the hotel in the lobby and were escorted to our room, except that our ""guide"" got lost and couldn't find our room!  She had to ask someone and after another trip to the lobby and up a lift we managed to get to the room.  We were asked for our credit card by the ""guide"" which she wrote down on a notebook.  I think this procedure is open to fraud as anyone having a written note of credit card details can do anything when they have the card details (this happened to us in Cypress when our card details were written down instead of using a credit card machine).The room was excellent in all regards except that there were bits on the floor and in the bathroom which indicated that it wasn't hoovered before we checked in, or they just did a bad job of it.  There was some construction going on outside our side of the hotel which was irritating and we complained about it.  Got an apology and an offer of some earplugs. It would have been nice to have been told beforehand that some work was going on.  Also, in the morning we were awakened by the shower running in the room adjacent to us which frankly was quite loud.   And finally, the tiles in front of the toilet were stained yellow, which was a little disconcerting, and when we mentioned it we were told that there were no stains!  White marble or marble effect tiles that looked like they had been stained over a period of time.We had the pre dinner menu at the hotel restaurant which was quite good, but a little pricey at £72.00 for 2 including a carafe of wine.All in all a lovely place and we would return, but for the RITZ- a little disappointing.", October 2013, Travelled as a couple

This world famous hotel, big building with few rooms and with more staff than guests ensure great service. But it is the hotel's extraordinary opulence and décor, more than any hotels I have seen, that exceed my highest expectation of what is ultimate luxury. I am simply stunned by the splendor going on my way to my room via the Palm Court where high tea is famously served from 11am to 7pm, and the restaurant breakfast is great in a equally opulent setting with waiting staff in white-tie!

The check in was a bit chaotic but highly compensated by the check out. For breakfast, we just wanted coffee and a croissant or toast. We were very surprised that there was a minimum charge of £29 pp and no alternative provided. We had a wonderful coffee across the street! We had asked for night service anytime after 7.30 pm. We came back at 11 pm to find that the room had not been done. It can happen. Only at this point did we put the ""do not disturb"" notice.

Hotel_Inspectors,29,18,Hmmmm dont know what to think....,[3.0],"I have just come back from spending a night here for my partners 30th birthday, I like to keep my reviews short and to the point so will just list the pros and cons:Pros: I must say i thought the attention to detail on everything was nice, Sky in the room was so nice to have, they brought a little happy birthday cake to our room which was a nice touch and very tasty, air con was fantastic but that was it really. Nothing spectacular and i have stayed in many 5* hotels in my time. Cons: For the money its not worth it, we ordered a burger from room service, and it was dry, had mustard and coleslaw in it, 3 onions rings on the side, 1 bit of lettuce and a slice of tomato and a few chips and it was nearly £30 Chips were not homemade, nor was the burger cooked to a medium. We had 2 fresh fruit juices in the bar downstairs and they were not fresh, fresh to me is freshly squeezed or juiced there and then from the actual fruit not fresh out of a carton. The breakfast was a joke, i paid £36 each for the full breakfast , my partner wanted pancakes which he had to pay £3 more for, they arrived and were 3 little pancakes that u can buy in the shops just warmed up and made to look fancy. This is The Ritz i know but you expect to have the best of the best and the best quality of EVERYTHING all freshly made etc. I dont mind paying for the best. I did complain in the morning about all of this to see what they could do and the receptionist said shed get someone to email me but 5 days later and no email.Overall it was a nice experience but i wouldn't stay here again, our next hotel was the Hilton on Park lane and that was a lot better.", October 2013, Travelled as a couple

Sue B,293,195,Just superb...,[5.0],"We have stayed at the Ritz a few times before for special occasions and this was no exception as it was my birthday treat.  We booked a Deluxe King for three days which was very large with ample space.  we really liked the fact that it was in a corner of the hotel meaning that it was nice and quiet, it was room 422.The decor was very traditional with antiques everywhere.  I have read other reviews about the afternoon tea brigade and how they didn't like it.  I think that it adds to the ambience of the place as it is clear that many people visit on a once in a lifetime basis.  It is great fun to sit in the long bar enjoying a bottle of champagne and watching the people come in and out for tea.  the service was first class and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff we encountered.We didnt have breakfast at the Ritz and had breakfast across the road at The Wolseley which was far cheaper and a good experience.The only downside i can think of is that the plumbing is very old and you have to be careful when in the shower as the temperature can be pretty inconsistent, I guess this is when someone else is having a shower or running a tap.We love the Ritz as it is a million miles away from most modern hotels that are all the same, this one is unique and very special.

Then the day finally arrived, it was wonderful from the moment we stepped out of the taxi and the warm welcome from the doorman and reception staff to the moment we left. The service was incredible, everyone just wanted to make our stay so special and this they did. The room was beautiful, in the rich blue Ritz colours, antique furniture and a marble bathroom, and those beds....heaven! Our room was serviced to a very high standard by Monica every day (thank you) and you notice that the staff are so cheerful, you  expect a certain degree of formality but they have hit it right, formality with friendliness, it works every time. We had afternoon tea and it was so nice,  we had breakfast too, what wonderful food and what a wonderful restaurant. We tried the cocktails and although a little strong it was fun to sit in the Rivoli bar. One of the nicest things to do is to have tea in the lobby, a great place to people watch and to appreciate everything that is the Ritz.

It was pleasing to see that no duvets are used, and the air-conditioning was superb, which made for a good nights sleep.  The bed and bed linen of course was five star and the turn down service each night was excellent with complimentary water provided.  The service at this hotel is some of the best we have seen worldwide, the staff are all so happy and obliging which certainly provides you with a sense of happiness as well.  The Ritz Restaurant provided us with excellent service and once again some of the best food we have experienced.  The live music was an added bonus that was a pleasant addition to the night and of course the magnificent decor made it a memorable night.Afternoon tea was a little disappointing, I thought the food presented was predictable and could be a little more innovative with more savoury food added to the plate and fresh sandwiches, not just taken out of the cold room.  Judging by the amount of males  attending I think savoury scones would go down well, service once again was outstanding.

Gorgeous common areas, dining room and bar and a great West End location.  Our room was a very nicely decorated decent sized.

Although the hotel is on a busy street, you do not notice that at all from inside or when coming or going.  The door, reception, housecleaning and concierge staff were all outstanding and accomodating.   We ate every morning and one dinner in the dining room during our five day say and the food was excellent.   A bit of up selling by the sommalier,  but not an issue.  He was VERY friendly and informative.   The only somewhat annoying issue, which did not bother my wife, was the very strict security.   There is always a finely dressed gentleman in the reception area that interacts with mostly everyone coming into the hotel.  I gather his purpose is to keep anyone other than guests out.  However, after five days I found it a bit annoying to be greeted by ""can I help you"" or ""room number, please"".  Never really encountered this level of security at other 5 star locations.

Andrew A,27,10,"Very Indulgent, I loved it.",[4.0],"A varied feeling to this hotel. When I booked, I selected two rooms as I was taking guests with me.  I also joined the Leaders Club and paid extra for a “Stay Enhancement” that should have given me an included breakfast and  a room upgrade to the next level. However when I checked in the stay enhancement was not honoured and I didn’t say anything about it.  The next morning however, when we arrived for breakfast I was advised (very politely) that breakfast was NOT included. I told the staff that I was under the impression that breakfast was included and the staff member went away to check for me. All the while my guests and I became very embarrassed as we waited the outcome. The staff member returned and (politely) confirmed that breakfast was NOT included. At this stage I was feeling very anxious and extremely embarrassed as I was sure that I had booked for breakfast to included. I then left my guests in the breakfast room (a beautiful room to be left in) and went to my room to get my IPad which had the booking confirmation. I then went to the reception desk to try and sort it out.  I showed the staff there my confirmation and was advised that contrary to what my confirmation showed, breakfast was only included for the guests in my room and not both rooms that I had booked.  They kindly told me that they would waive the fees for that mornings breakfast for me and my guests but the embarrassment had set in too far so we drank some orange juice and left with our heads bowed. Needless to say, the four of us did not return for breakfast for the next four days we were there.The next issue was the mix up with payments. When I checked in I was debited $5000 deposit for the stay plus $2000 blocked on my credit card, I was expecting this so I was prepared for this. The next day I was debited a further $3000. Before the end of my stay I was debited a further $8000. Then I was credited $5000. The next day I was credited the $3000. Two days after checking out I was debited $8000 which was the amount due for my stay. In the end the amounts debited and credited balanced out and the audit trail was clear on my credit card statement so I knew it would be sorted out, however I’m fortunate that I didn’t max out my credit card. It is a shame though that whilst the money was in limbo I couldn’t use it to spend whilst in London.Apart from that, the hotel is a beautiful baroque masterpiece, the staff were always nice and greeted us every time we left and returned. The rooms were spotlessly clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. It is in a fantastic position close to great shopping, wonderful sights and some very nice restaurants.I don’t mind the confusion with the payments, but the embarrassment of the breakfast saga left me very uncomfortable.

In a good hotel you should be able to do what you want, when you want, wearing what you want. Not here I'm afraid.

It was the most enjoyable two hours.The food was fabulous and plentiful more than I would have expected.My only regret was that we did not request a doggie bag for what we could not finish and saw so many people leave with their left over goodies in Ritz boxes., September 2013, Travelled as a couple
ColetteK683,116,19,Nice London Feel,[4.0],"The Ritz London is a classic hotel with a great London feel. Very old, but fits with how you should feel when staying in London.

tomtom9,89,44,An experience of a lifetime,[5.0],"The Ritz lived up to its reputation as being one of the finest hotels in the world from the time we arrived, checked in, met with the concierge for theatre tickets topped off with a wonderful suite overlooking the park.  The rooms are elegant and can tell the bathrooms have been updated as well.  Breakfast was included with our suite and the breakfast served in their main dining room can either be full service breakfast (order anything off the menu) or one can enjoy their continental buffet.  We had the full breakfast every morning and everything was served perfectly cooked.  Had to get used to service staff dressed so formally in the morning but, the breakfast was served formally as well.  Location of the hotel was also excellent.  You are right in Picadilly and can walk to theatre district, Bond Street, Regent Street, Chinatown and another 15 minute walk and you are in Covent Gardens.  We did cab it to Harrods in the Kensington area.  High Tea was outstanding with unbelievable scones, pastries, sandwiches which they continue to refill until you are full.Overall we are glad to have had this luxurious experience at the Ritz.  However, one must be warned if you have to watch your budget and cringe at having high tea at the cost of $70.00/person US...Ritz may not be the place for you.  On the other hand, if you want to experience the Ritz and you can tolerate the cost of the experience, you won't regret it.", August 2013, Travelled on business

We have never experienced this level of service or attention to detail. Our stay was sheer perfection in every sense. I would like to thank the Manager and Concierge for making our Honeymoon an event to remember. From the ""Happy Honeymoon"" Rose Champagne, Rose Petal Turn Down Service, High Tea, Helicopter Tour Reservations and the hard to secure Sushi Samba Reservations, I can't imagine a better place to stay.  We are lifetime fans of the Ritz London and no other hotel can ever measure up to their perfection. Thank you so much for our special experience.

meitaki,77,17,"Elegance, style and TLC",[5.0],"Everything you would expect from the Ritz you get...and then some more.  .  You step through the doors from a busy London street into elegance and style.   We're not among the mega-rich or even rich (sadly!), but at no time were we made to feel anything less than special.  The welcome was warm, the check in extremely efficient and the staff smart and superbly professional.  We chose the hotel for a special birthday celebration and were surprised with a beautifully iced little ""happy birthday"" cake during afternoon tea and a rendition of the the song on the grand piano..  You MUST have afternoon tea - even at £45  per person - to make your stay complete.  And when we ordered morning tea in our room the following day - the actual birthday - we were treated to another birthday cake.   The beds are superbly comfortable and the linen of the highest quality.  The bathroom was large, full of fluffy towels and the toileteries from the Prince of Wales Highgrove estate.   This was TLC with style.  The only fault we could find was with one of the waiting on staff at afternoon tea who had marks on his otherwise immaculate tailcoat.   This is a hotel to spoil yourself in and be proud that it's part of Britain's heritage.", September 2013, Travelled as a couple
Clive B,126,52,Service and style beyond your dreams.,[5.0],Everything about this experience was first class. When you make a reservation you speak to the hotel itself not some anonymous call centre in America unlike some of the competition. Lets make no mistake about it this is one of the worlds most exclusive hotels so ones expectations are already high. I booked two Deluxe King rooms one for my wife and I and one for my daughter whose graduation we were celebrating. The reception staff were so welcoming and friendly that we felt special the moment we arrived. The reception Manager Dimitri Cigliano was absolutely first class and exemplified what we hope to find at such a historic landmark. We are not rich and had saved hard for this special day but sometimes there is a difference between cost and value. This cost a lot but represented good value in our view.We booked a celebration package which included champagne in the room and a celebration cake. Quite unbelievably we were upgraded and the rooms were something else. It was absolute dreamland and the time we spent in this hotel will live with us forever as will the friendliness of all the staff. Absolutely wonderful thank you to the Ritz.If you wanted a comparison to Paris I think that The Ritz in London was comparable to The Plaza Athenee whereas The Savoy is more comparable to the George Cinq if that helps. I should say that I have not stayed at The Ritz in Paris but maybe I should., September 2013, Travelled with family
gibsonsarah261171,164,62,Perfect location; excellent service,[5.0],"Just enjoyed three excellent nights at the Ritz with my husband. From meeting our taxi on arrival to seeing us off again, everyone was polite, efficient and helpful. We were greeted by name whenever in the lobby, my waiter at breakfast remembered my coffee preferrence and Anna in the spa fitted me in for an emergency nail repair with no fuss. Being members of the Luxury Hotels of the World, we got a special rate that included breakfast, so I shall say little about ""value"" - but it's the Ritz. We had Afternoon Tea one day - again very well looked after, with lots to eat. Great treat! Much busier than the Savoy, so tables were closed together making us prefer the other - sorry, Ritz. Our room was compact but sported a large bathroom and substantial walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was supplied with significantly more towels than two people could ever use, which meant I could sacrifice a couple to the floor after showers. There are only two chairs - one straight backed at the dressing table and only armchair, so one of us ended sitting on the bed alot. We had room service one night. There are no space for the trolley and two chairs to be set up, so I sat on the bed (again!). The waitress was very embarressed. We did think room service - it was expensive for a burger and club sandwich. Both came with egg not mentioned when ordering - fried on the burger (my husband does like egg) and included in the vege club - not all vege's eat egg.On check-out there were two minor errors on the bill - both corrected with no fuss.Being in central London allowed us to walk almost everywhere, Green Park is next door for some fresh air and Green Park station another step if needed.", September 2013, Travelled as a couple

Wtravel66,92,83,Dissapointing service - never thought to encounter that at the Ritz,[2.0],"Made reservations 6 mo in advance for this trip to London for my mothers 70th birthday. Requested 2 quiet rooms next to each other. Paid about $900 a day per room, $1800 total per day. Called again a week in advance, confirmed that we would have 2 rooms next to each other. Arrived late, tired, to the hotel - and -guess what? - they NEVER HEARD that we wanted rooms next to each other! I thought Ritz prizes itself on accommodating a customer, no?Were offered rooms on 2 different floors. Went and checked them out. One room was next to elevator. Explained to staff that we are light sleepers, requested quiet rooms well in advance and room next to elevator will not do. And guess what - there apparently was NO OTHER free room in the hotel.They were ""fully booked"" except for several suits, which were offered to us - but not for free, of course - they offered us those if we pay the difference between cost of first 2 rooms and a $3000 a night suite. And when I refused to pay another $1200 a night! - the attitude came - ""Well, if you can't afford it... then we can't help you"". I could not believe I was at the Ritz - honestly, may be in Europe that is normal??? My expectation would be that we are immediately offered a night in a suite for the first night, until they can find adjoining rooms. It was their incompetence that created the problem to start with!No, that did not happen. I spend a night in a room next to elevator (without unpacking my suitcase) and my mother on another floor. Next day a room opened up next to my mothers and I moved there (in the afternoon). Now, how did the hotel make it up to us for this trouble? The manager knocked on my door and asked if I was OK in the new room. Then she left. No gesture was made, nothing at all.Just in comparison, same thing happened to us last year in Paris. Hotel was fully booked, a guest had a heath issue and could not leave the room - so we ended up staying in a smaller room for one night. That hotel picked up our breakfast tab for our whole stay and sent some champagne to our room in appreciation of our patience. But I guess not at the Ritz.The Ritz fully knew it was my mothers 70-th birthday, but chosen once again not to acknowledge that in any way. For a hotel that is so proud of their service and attention to detail??!!! Really??? Could you send flowers? Candy? A note from the manager?One disappointment after another. Little annoyances followed - no coffeemaker in the room and no coffee in the lobby even - so you have 2 choices: 1. Call room service and have your room invaded by a stranger first thing in the morning. 2 Get dressed and walk across street to coffee shop. I really want my coffee first thing in morning; I want to drink it in my pajamas and not talk to strangers in service uniform! Instead was forced to get room service every day - last day could not take it any more and went across street to coffee shop. Very few outlets in a room and they are located near floor under furniture. So literally you have to climb under tables to plug in your cell phone charger. Huge keys you have to give to the lobby guy every time and then get them back.  I honestly thought I forgot this whole experience, except that I tried to plan another trip, this time to BVI and Ritz came up in my search results. Only then did I realize that the London Ritz have ruined my attitude of Ritz chain in general - I have no interest in staying there ever again:((( Not in any location.", June 2013, Travelled with family

TMCLondonUK,48,26,Faultless,[5.0],"I had booked a one night stay as a special treat for my wifes 40th birthday and all my expectations were met easily. As I was driving there I had already made the hotel aware that I required parking, and on arrival the doorman had our luggage removed and car taken away very swiftly (the traffic wardens are a menace in the west end). Booking in was effortless and we were then taken to our room by William who also gave us a quick tour of the hotel pointing out its various amenities. Once at the room he explained that we had also been given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe executive room. The room was huge and furnished beautifully. The bed was superkingsize and very comfortable. There was ample storage space for our clothes and it was nice to see that was a selection of clothes hanger types. The rest of the rom was well appointed with a safe, minibar, writing desk &  dresser. Also a sofa with 2 armchairs and a large coffee table. I had ordered a bouquet of hand tied flowers for  my wife and they were of a very high quality. Sitting next to them on the table was a small birthday cake and a hand written card from the Ritz wishing my wife a happy birthday. This was quite unexpected and really was a lovely surprise. They even put a little candle to one side. It's the little things like this that make all the difference when staying at a quality hotel. It shows that the guest is being thought of as more than a source of revenue. .... As for the rest of the room, we had a view onto Piccadilly, being a townie this suited me fine, the noise from the road was negligible. Also provided was a decent size lcd TV with Sky and a Bose soundwave radio. The in house wifi was straigtforward to set up too. The bathroom was again nicely appointed with a nice selection of toiletries and very comfy bathrobes. I did think however that it was a little small in comparison to the size of the main room, (my last visit to the west end was at The Savoy and the bathroom was twice the size).   We didn't dine at the hotel as we had reservations at Le Gavroche. We did have a post meal drink in the Rivoli bar though. Very pleasant art deco style, you can easily imagine guests from the 1920s and 30's enjoying a cocktail or two here... word to the wise though, pay attention to what you order as the vintage cocktails can hit £200 each !!!! We decided to have continental breakfast in the room the following morning, again faultless. Checking out was quick and easy, although a mistake was made on the bill, which I didnt notice till later in the day. One phone call took care of that and they were of course very apologetic.   In conclusion, we had a very enjoyable stay. The staff were very attentive and easy to talk to and nothing appeared to be too much bother. The hotel is very elegant and has a very tradional English feel to it although has many hidden modern sides tucked away. Yes it is expensive, however I'm a firm believer in what you pay is what you get, and I'm very happy with what we got. Go on treat yourself or a loved one, you won't regret it........", September 2013, Travelled as a couple

Luckily my husband had brought a jacket with him but if he hasn't we wouldn't have been able to have drinks in the hotel bar (he was wearing smart jeans in the evening so wouldn't have been able to get into the restaurant even if we wanted to).

SGTravel10,793,74,A world away - Regal & Charming,[5.0],"The Ritz London!! Travelled and stayed in several hotels but this one is an institution. Few hotels evoke the response like the Ritz. Land @ Heathrow and hail a cab - all you need to say is ""am going to the Ritz"". Done. Of course the rooms are expensive but then there is only one Ritz. The hotel is 5 minutes walk to the Palace cutting through Green Park, the tube is at the doorstep and you can walk to most of the attractions - Houses of Parliament (Big Ben), London Eye, Trafalgar Square etc. The service is excellent, the staff well trained to take care of every need and the doorman knew us by name!! The rooms have a very classic theme and are huge given that this is Central London. Breakfast at the Ritz restaurant was a special treat. Overlooking Green Park a perfect start to the day. They do have a dresscode for the restaurant (except breakfast) so take note. We had martinis at the Rivoli bar and they were superb.Overall, the Ritz is an expirience. They should be forgiven for some minor shortcomings which we experienced but worth the overall satisfaction of living at this address.", May 2013, Travelled on business

We have had afternoon tea at the ritz four times now, the latest being July 2013. We have found the experience wonderful each time, never a slip in the service or the food. The staff are discreet but welcoming and go out of their way to ensure that you have a lovely time, we've even been the last two occasions we have taken the kids and they are made to feel equally welcome. The scones are the best scones I've ever eaten, so soft and light, nothing like any other scones we've had, and as for the cakes.....truly scrumptious. The best thing about their tea, even though it is pricey, the cakes/sandwiches/scones just keep coming, you can literally eat as many as you can manage! Fantastic. Would recommend to anyone as a special treat and an unforgettable experience. We were also lucky enough to stay a night at the Ritz for our 10th wedding anniversary, and again the entire experience exceeded our expectations, purely down to their careful attention to detail, little things including the DVD library that you could borrow and the beautiful marble bathrooms.", July 2013, Travelled with family

Yes certainly this means a shortened trip from the far side of the world but the Ritz experience far out weighs the cost. We have just enjoyed a 6 day return. Being remembered by staff makes one feel so special. The Hall Porters can magically obtain the tickets or bookings that you discover should have been made before you left home!! A visit to the Ritz Salon was a wonderful treat. Rooms are cleaned to a high standard. We especially appreciated the turn down service in the evening with all toiletries and towels replenished, rubbish removed as well as water and slippers put out beside the bed. This stay included an evening meal in the hotel. What a treat. The food and service were out if this world in a dining room which has to be one of the most gracious and beautiful in the world.

I had the most delicious pepper soup which I have never had before, and I can highly recommend it. For main course I had duck and for sweet I had a soufle with ice cream, the soufle was perfection. We had unlimited melba toast and unsalted butter and the champagne was wonderful chilled and went down very very well. We were given a free refill of coffee.

Jose Maria F,18,16,As close to perfect as you can get !,[5.0],"It's not easy to write a review about the Ritz without abounding in superlatives.  I used to stay in London in other wonderful five stars hotel in the Mayfair area -by the way, I think this is the best area to stay in London for a tourist-. A couple of years ago it was fully booked and then I chose the Ritz as an alternative to stay there for five days with my family. It was so good that we decided to repeat the experience and booked two rooms for almost a week this month. Our two rooms were wonderful and very spacious. The staff was helpful and friendly -and not at all snobbish- without being intrusive. They were always willing to go the the extra length to help you. Only as an example: on Sunday Aug 4 the hotel area was affected by the Prudential Ride London and we had tickets for a 9 a.m. exhibition at the British Museum. I asked to a doorman what area he would recommend us to go to get a taxi. In spite I assured him I knew perfectly well the neighborhood he walked with us three blocks -he previously gave notice of what he was doing to his supervisor- and ran almost a block to get us a taxi.The waiter remembered what were our preferences for breakfast and the reception people make you feel at home from the beginning. Obviously perfect is almost impossible. Perhaps the dress code is a bit dated -but of course this is a debatable opinion- and once my 19 years old son was denied access to the breakfast saloon because he was using a bermuda short. And one occasion  we left our rooms and 11 a.m. and found they were being made when we returned a 4 p.m.But definitely the Ritz has been very, very close to perfect and undoubtedly will be staying there on our next trip to London.

Although we had requested a higher floor we expected to be mid way and as I had expressly asked if we could have a view whether it be the Park or Piccadilly it was with some disappointment we found ourselves way up on the sixth floor with a small window overlooking the backs of buildings and with a limited view of down the Thames towards Battersea Power Station!  There were some nice touches in the room and the bed turn down was very prettily done with rose petals but I truly expected more from The Ritz as regards accommodation.  We enjoyed the afternoon tea but felt that the cake selection could be improved upon although the trifle was lovely!   The breakfast was good and my husband especially enjoyed the kippers which were amongst the best he has eaten.  All in all I believe that the hotel is trading on it’s past reputation.

Do saviour the time as it goes so quick ( I am aware they need to prepare for the next seating) however 1 1/2 hours is a pleasant time to begin to move away, not before.

There are no tea/coffee makings in the rooms - but if you're at the Ritz why would make tea/coffee yourself.  The staff will bring kettle etc if you ask though.

We had a junior suite which was large but as some reports mention, dated bathrooms and the smallest shower ever. We frequented the bar and restaurants and they were great apart from the service, you needed to ask 3 or 4 times for an item, you were served by different people all the time making it hard to remember what you wanted.

On top of the stand was a selection of small cakes. You could have as many sandwiches as you wished,  then they came around with scones, which were light, but a little lacking in sultanas, accompanied by fresh clotted cream and strawberry jam. A small trifle in a glass. Then a trolley arrived with a black forest gateau and a lemon drizzle cake., A separate selection of gluten free cakes came to the table, which were very good.

cucuruchito,357,197,I love The Ritz London,[5.0],"The Ritz is a smooth travel in time, the spirit of the hotel magically brings to our time a kind of ambience, decor, flavors, manners and service of a past  golden era. The feeling of warmth and protection provided by the soft colors, the piano, the atmosphere and the wonderful concierge team has no possible comparison. The afternoon tea is the best in London by far,not only for location reasons or for being in the wonderful Palm Court Room but for the freshness of the sandwichs, the soft scones coming right from the oven , and the attentive and kind service of the waiters. Everything worths every penny. The front desk assistant managers are great. A special mention here, for the team of concierges. They are the best I ve ever seen, the most professional team with a valuable sense of humour and  efficient enough to do their best to find you that difficult seat for that show or that table at the fanciest restaurant. I have to name here Andy, who welcomes us as if we were family , Mike and Paul, as well, out of this world professionals, I thank them all again for making such a difference when we look back at our time in London and at The Ritz.If I think of things to improve I might find some... but I love this hotel so much I m afraid I can t.. at this point after having stayed many times, I think I love The Ritz as it is and I just hope it does not change.", July 2013, Travelled with family
Persis647,105,69,Magical Evening!,[5.0],We took friends for a very special celebratory dinner and the Ritz certainly lived up to it's name!The decor is stunning and the staff welcoming and very attentive. It is very regal and has an air of being in a Palace in somwhere like Paris or Vienna.We had a glass of champagne on arrival -  first class quality (as you would expect) which set the tone . The menu was exceptionally good and suited everyone's tastes - in fact it took ages to choose!  We were not rushed in any way and the staff were pleased to advise us on tastes.You get exactly what you pay for - exceptionally high quality in every regard. There was even a quartet playing unobtrusively. We had such a wonderful time and have a lovely memory shared with very good friends.

The tea refreshing & flavoursome & most welcome on a hot Saturday afternoon. My husband requested a tune to be played on the piano & we was delighted to hear it a little while later.

Having not stayed in such a grand hotel before we were naturally concerned as to how we would be greeted, Our fears were totally unfounded with the only sign of snobbery was from the foreign waiter at breakfast to obviously considered it as being beneath to offer to pour our coffee. The front desk staff were superb as was the manager who are finding out we had not stayed before showed us round all the public rooms. As to our bedroom the walk in wardrobe was bigger than our kitchen and I could have happily gone to sleep in the bathroom.

Unfortunately, the heat and a race in central London conspired to delay us and the only way we could complete our journey was on foot.  The ladies in our party, clothed as they were for a summer's day managed just fine but us lads wary of falling foul of the dreaded 'dress code' sweltered in our jackets and ties.  The welcome was professional but warm (just like us) and we stayed in that overheated state for some time.Taken overall I would say the afternoon was fine with rare teas, simply superb cakes and sandwiches that were just a touch erring on the side of being too ordinary in comparison.Take another look at the sandwiches and apply some common sense towards the gentlemen in this heat and I'd give you 5 stars.", July 2013, Travelled with family

It was opposite Green Park underground station, Beside the green park and walking distance from the Buckingham palace. The check in was Warm, friendly, smooth right from all the smiling door men, concierge and checking in assistants. We were given a tour of a hotel (we were in our Jeans and t-Shirts :) but were never made to feel out of place as they do understand people dont travel in full formals. The room was showed and fully explained. A gift neatly wrapped for my son and a welcome note. The room was DEEE--VINE !! Luxxxiourious !! Cool !! Spacious !! Excellent TV Channells (Important if you have 5 y/o) They even had a lil bed for my SON !! The most Comfortable Bed !! The Bathroom well equipped with separate toiletries for my Kid and Heated Towel Racks.. The staff are the Best .. they make you feel welcome and no request is ever too much ... They have good information of the locality and willing to give any assistance.. I dont remember all their names but a few such as Dimas & Sachin and the two guys standing outside in their Tall Hats one Big Built Man (Very Very Cheerfull) and another Thin Guy also pleasing and helpful an elderly gent with a tail coat when you enter, very charming and smiling :)The evening turn down service is great, the lady doing our room in 408 was amazing, plus the hotel left us goodies every night, including drinking chocolate for my son and bottles of water and cake :)The food here is amazing, have to try the grilled fish, it just melts in your mouth, the kids burger is great and so is the grilled lamb and chicken !!The High Tea is something to be experienced, excellent quality of tea, we had the Ritz tea, great scones, chocolate cake to diee for, black forest cake, sandwiches good ambiance and once again amazing staff. They keep filling your plate till you have to actually have to ask them to stop !  I thought 2 hours for Tea is too much, later i realised that 2 hours was too less...The check out was smooth. Was sad we could not get a hours extension but the hotel was full and the staff kept our bags in the hotel and we went shopping and when we returned we were put into a hospitality suite which had tea, coffee, fruits, water, internet, laptops printers chess boards and wash rooms. What else could one ask for...on the negative side ... Hmmmm i cant think of any.... our room did not have a iron with a ironing board and a water heating kettle but one call and it was in our room in 5 minutes !. SO if you want to be picky yes there was not tea or coffee making facility but we had our baggage stocked with those sachets ....Just writing it so readers can take their stuff and not let such petty matters dampen their stay at this LOVELY hotel ....... so who cares .... It is something I would not even consider...We were put in our Taxi of preference and were sad to leave.. But can surely say that it was one of the best ever experiences .....All in all a world class stay, with high class lodging, great sleep value, and Amazing Staff (they make you feel at home and also dont make you feel out of place..without being too pompous) The staff add great value to the excellent place they call the THE RITZ !!!", July 2013, Travelled with family

We were limited with the choice of luxury star hotels at a reasonable price as everything was heavily booked. We were able to secure their lowest cost room a Superior Room. What a beautiful and well sized room it was on the 5th floor. We stayed three days. Amazingly is was only about 50 quid a night dearer than hotels that have no where near the fame of the Ritz. The place overall was faultless. Quite surprisingly, one has to wear a jacket and tie in their Palm Court and main restaurant and no jeans! Casual was okay in the restaurant for breakfast but no sports shoes allowed. All a very dignified experience.

All three required a series of follow up calls to different people and for the latter two I was detained for 30 minutes each time; on my short holiday.  Add to that the constant stream of people into my room either checking the bar fridge, installing smoke detectors or delivering something I found there was no time to enjoy the room.  Like McDonald's you had to queue for breakfast and hope that the staff would acknowledge you so that you could join the waiting list.  The staff were a huge joke such that I suspect they have an ongoing game to see how far they can push their guests.

Everything is flawless. Service, concierge, decor, ambiance, quality, experience, offerings - top notch. In looking to find a flaw, one morning the waiter seemed oddly fixated on the next table and provided us with very little attention. I had to sharply re request orange juice and coffee to snap him out of being entirely hypnotized by the next table. I wish this had not been the case because otherwise it would have been a totally unblemished experience. Having said that, so much was extraordinary that I can overlook one or two not great times in the dining room. Also, as a Leaders Club member, this was my best overall experience. The special membership arrival welcome, gifts and perks were amazing and there was absolutely no game play with the room upgrade etc. and, finally access to The Ritz Club was an additional perk and a fun way to spend a few hours.

Tomtomgoer,80,54,Everything you would expect,[5.0],"We stayed at this iconic, landmark hotel in July 2013. Originally planned for Afternoon Tea, decided to stay the night. On checking in, we were asked a few questions about the reasons for our stay, which resulted in a double upgrade of our room, which reflected the rest of our experience throughout our stay. Afternoon Tea was a sumptuous affair, taken in The Palm Court, a gorgeous room which reflected the overall quality of the rest of the hotel. Tea was, as you would expect, superb and the fresh sandwiches, cakes and scones were top quality. The staff were attentive without being overly so, and all accompanied by a superb resident pianist. Highly recommended experience which we will definitely repeat in the future. Our room for the night was located on the first floor, was more a suite and was beautiful, including a good size, large bathroom with bath and separate shower, all with elegant furnishings and real gold leaf decor. I called for an iron and ironing board and within 2 minutes a member of staff had brought them to me! The bed was most comfortable, resulting in one of the best sleeps my wife has had in a long time. Breakfast the following morning in The Ritz Restaurant was an equally beautiful affair, located in one of the finest rooms I have ever eaten in. All the food was excellent although, as avid coffee drinkers, we felt the coffee could have been better; more our taste than anything particularly wrong, was just a bit weak. Overall experience was one of being completely indulged, an unforgettable experience which we look forward to repeating in the future. A particular mention to the gentleman on reception when we checked in. He arranged the room upgrade and settled us in with a pot of tea while we waited for the change of room.

We were there for a family celebration, and the luxurious setting, extremely attentive service, pleasant piano music and quite delicious food and tea made our event feel very special indeed.  Gents require a jacket and tie, so be prepared, but this requirement just helps add to the sense of occasion.  We were booked in at 19:30, so this doesn't have to be just an afternoon event - we chose to treat it as our evening meal and certainly didn't feel that we needed anything more.  It is possible to park for free in some of the nearby streets after 18:30, but as Green Park tube is just a few metres away public transport is probably the easiest option.

Passingthru63,133,56,My favorite hotel in the whole world,[5.0],"We have stayed at the ritz several times and always welcomed by the staff like a home away from home ( in an English, dignified manner of course! ) and this time was no different. The trip took a turn for the worst when my partner became gravely ill. The staff at the ritz were wonderful - not only did they get us sorted medically in no time without fuss or bother but they kindly and considerately looked out for me the rest of my stay as I ended up spending my entire trip to London without my partner who was rushed to hospital &stayed there for almost 2 weeks. The ritz team from managers to doorman to room service and reception consistently checked up on me and showed me sincere care and concern in what was a very stressful time. I was even walked to my room late at night after being in the hospital all day as a kindness by the night porter.  I have always felt at home at the ritz and am now convinced it is the only place I would stay in London; not only is it beautiful & perfectly located - but it has a heart.", March 2013,nan
christine b,55,67,"Short stay at the Ritz, London",[5.0],"What a wonderful birthday treat.      The service starts on the pavement outside.   We arrived by taxi and the cab door was opened by one of the very smart doormen.   He was welcoming and efficient.   Our case was taken from us and it was subsequently delivered to our room.We stayed at the Ritz in a Superior King  room.The room was excellent with everything you could possibly want.   It was the largest bed we have ever slept in and it was supremely comfortable.   In the bathroom was a selection of great toiletries as well as two bathrobes.   We had afternoon tea.   The palm court restaurant is beautiful and the service is exemplary.  The sandwiches were delicious and kept being replenished.   Then homemade scones, jam and clotted cream.   Then trifle and gateaux.   Followed by pastries.   A choice of at least ten types of tea and all accompanied by a pianist on a grand piano.When we returned to our room we found a birthday cake and bottle of champagne waiting for us with a card of best wishes from the hotel.We went to a West End Show  and when we returned our bed was turned down, the lamps lit,slippers out and a bottle of mineral water provided.We slept wonderfully in comfort and peace.   Breakfast in the most magnificent dining room in Europe was beyond compare.   The ornate beauty of the dining room took my breath away.    We could have had a full English breakfast but the buffet breakfast would be enough for any mortal.   The choice was outstanding.   Amongst a whole array of offerings, I had the most delicious yoghurt I have ever had.I can only recommend the Ritz as the perfect treat to make you feel like royalty.   Best things - the staff.

SwissG_7,33,43,Fit for a king if he is Charles I !,[5.0],"A recent stay was proof enough of the astounding qualities of the Ritz Hotel in London 1. Great staff : Any request is handled with warmth and efficiency by any member of the staff with whom you interact. From the maid up to the Concierge. With no fuss  your wishes are speedily fulfilled 2. Location and facilities: Ideally situated on the edge of Green Park, close to Bond Street and to the Theater district and a few yards away from major museums, you get it all : greenery, Shopping, entertainment and culture. Across Green Park you will find Clarence House and Buckingham palace. Indoors the  décor brings back the happy times (for the privileged few) of Edwardian England although facilities  are all brilliantly 2013 . Wifi is particularly strong and works beautifully. 3. Breakfast and High Tea:Breakfast in the all gold and silk dining room with wood paneling to make Majorelle jealous is a quiet feast giving you the opportunity to display your prowess at handling silver cutlery and at not breaking exquisitely fragile  bone china . The array of food on display is refreshingly limited acknowledging the fact that guests do not come here to pig out. Do not get me wrong though. Food is plentiful but there is a clever approach on how to highlight its quality and sophistication.Obviously I had High Tea  with friends of mine as no one can resist the lure of having Tea at the Ritz What a fun and delightful experience! While the finger sandwiches were good , scones were the best we ever had and the trifle was to die for and the Black Forest cake reached that level of perfection that strengthens your belief in the existence of a greater and better universe. The first glass of champagne was deemed nice, the second excellent, the third a tribute to the craftsmanship of French wine makers.The waiters behaved admirably and did not flinch when asked to take a picture.4. AlasI must regretfully point out that all is not well in ParadiseI got  a 4 feet large bed  that only Charles I could qualify as a king size bed.I booked a Deluxe king size room. I paid for a Deluxe king size room. However, I had to make do with a bed fit for Charles I  (5""4) after January 30th  1649 (remember, He was beheaded on that day)5. Next time? Except that ridiculously tiny bed everything else was actually enchanting. I may be convinced to go back but to a different room", June 2013, Travelled with friends

The sandwiches and cakes just kept coming and the staff were very pleasant and polite. Couple of things which didn't seem quite right though. Where I was sat, I could see out at all the other tables. One waiter was doing the tea orders and another was bringing out the sandwiches. All the tables I could see had had both delivered to their table but nobody had been to us yet. Slightly disappointing as the anticipation is quite high. Interesting that the doors were opened for us on the way in, but not on the way out. Perhaps I'm being picky.I think there are three sittings for afternoon tea and we booked for the 3.30pm. At such an establishment, I would have expected the tables to have been laid ready but we had to stand and wait for this to be complete.Cannot fault the food, high quality, fresh and plentiful.

Linda D,36,11,WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH,[5.0],"I must write to tell you of our wonderful two night stay.  I took my daughter for her 17 Birthday she was amazed and loved the ambiance of the place.  The reception staff were welcoming and wished my daughter a happy birthday on our arrival.  We were given a short tour of the Hotel and then shown to our room having been given an upgrade.  It was amazing.  We left and spent the afternoon at Harrods and upon our return to our room there was a Birthday cake and little top hat with sweets laid out on a tray with a hand written card with birthday wishes on.  How lovely.  We then went to a show in the evening  returning around 11.p.m.  Rang room service for hot chocolate it arrived within ten minutes with a smile, the hot chocolate was lovely.  Next morning we had breakfast in the dining room. We were shown to our table,  napkin swiftly laid across our knees and with a smile our order was taken.  When the tea arrived it was poured for us, and as soon as our cups were empty refills were given and always with a smile.  We had plenty of hot water in our room.  The beds were very comfortable, loved the old fashioned key for our room door and could leave it with the concierge when we went out, no worry about losing it.   Retuned around 5.p.m. on Wednesday and the head concierge asked my daughter if she would like a half hour ride in the Ritz Rolls.  (what a question).  She sat in the Rolls looking like a queen and waving to everyone.  To Winston our chauffeur THANK YOU.  Afterwards had afternoon Tea at 7.30.p.m.  Good time to have this as we were so busy during the day.  The waiters made us feel very special, Absolutely stunning food, sandwiches, cakes to die for and the scones arrived warm and just melted in the mouth. The waiter took a photograph of us at the table, we took one of him. Had the same waiter right through.  We asked if we could have the afternoon menu as a keep sake.  Of course was the reply.  They must of had a busy day but you would not of known.  The pianist was lovely as the music played  in the back ground.  My daughter thought she was in heaven.  Afterwards went to the Rivoli Bar for non alcoholic  cocktail and a coffee for me the waiter took us back to sit in the long hall and brought our drinks to us such a nice end to the day.  NOTHING was too much trouble.  Had breakfast on our final morning. The breakfast at all times was of course excellent.   I know the Ritz has relaxed dress rule for breakfast which I think is a good idea.  BUT, to the gentleman who sat with his baseball cap on and refused to remove it I assume wanted to make a point.  Silly man.  Even my daughter thought him so rude.  To Benjamin, Assistant Manager I would like to say a huge Thank You.  And to all the staff including the concierge gentleman for making our stay so special Thank You.  The only slight blip in our stay was just before we left waiting in the foyer to take a photo of the concierge reception area a rather overzealous member of staff who jumped on me telling me I could not take photographs inside the Ritz. Please don't be so mean. Photographs are the most important part of any special holiday.  My daughter has been back to college and has done a short thesis of her stay using the photographs.  This was a birthday treat but also part of her education on travel.  Many of her peers will probably never have the opportunity of visiting the Ritz and loved all the photographs taken.  So please don't stop guest from taking them.  TO ALL AT THE RITZ A VERY BIG THANK YOU GIVING US VERY SPECIAL MEMORIES WHICH WILL STAY WITH US FOR EVER.", May 2013, Travelled with family

She was anticipating staying in an ordinary hotel in London so was bemused when we pulled up outside The Ritz with luggage being unpacked.

One problem was, when dining at the Ritz restaurant the last time, we were only offered Ritz branded Champagne from the usually plentiful wine trolley and at the end when we ordered our cheese course we were only offered a stark selection of cheeses, not of our choosing, with three water crackers each and some condiments. Usually, the cheese selection, came around on a beautiful trolley and we could pick our preference, along with a choice of crackers or biscuits and a selection of grapes, dates and chutney's to go with our choice, followed with a selection of port's - Please restore these thing's if you have not already, as it makes all the difference in the world the experience, especially when spending £500 odd on a meal for three.

We had the most divine rooms overlooking St James' Park, on the first floor of the hotel and were absolutely touched and delighted that even somewhere like the Ritz, which surely doesn't need to curry favour with anyone, thought to surprise us like this.Our stay was a treat from start to finish and I would totally encourage anyone reading this and thinking of doing the same on their anniversary!", May 2013, Travelled as a couple

Katiescot,20,10,Afternoon tea at the Ritz - fantastic experience,[5.0],"For £47 (and that's without champagne), afternoon tea at the Ritz doesn't come cheap, and in any other venues you might come away feeling a bit short-changed. But the Ritz experience is absolutely worth every penny! The setting is incredibly lavish, and the waiters were all extremely attentive, meaning that it feels like a very special experience from beginning to end. The food was all delicious, and you'll be provided with as much of everything (sandwiches, cakes, scones, tea, more cakes) as you could ever want to eat - so try not to get too over-excited by how good it is at the start, you've got an hour and a half so it's worth pacing yourself a bit!All in all, the perfect venue for a special treat, and something that you definitely won't forget in a hurry!", May 2013, Travelled with family

Jodie R,182,82,What a wonderful way to start our honeymoon.,[5.0],"We decided to treat ourselves to a stay in one of the worlds most famous hotels and we weren't disappointed. If you stay here you know the dress codes and the expense so it annoys more when people complain about it, yes is was expensive and yes you have to abide by dress codes but that's the whole point of staying here surely? We had a fabulous check in, they even rang housekeeping for them to check our room before we were allowed to go up. Whilst we waited we went for a drink in the bar, on your way in you do notice the security that just makes me feel secure, don't see why people get worked up about this! The rivoli bar is beautiful, the service was just as you would expect, we also had a pre dinner drink in here as well, the cocktails are amazing. Our room was very comfortable, beautiful and plush. We had afternoon tea, yes you need a tie guys, they do 400 a day! It was beautiful and so was the setting, for me it was a little impersonal but a good experience. At dinner we had the tasting menu with wine, worth every penny. The food and sommelier were excellent so were the staff, again a beautiful room. We stayed at the start of our honeymoon so we went with the intention of not looking at prices and we fully enjoyed the whole experience, its a pity we couldn't stay there every time we went to London as you would need deep pockets, I would if I could though everyone there is exceptional at their job. What an experience. Thank you for a beautiful start to our honeymoon.", March 2013, Travelled as a couple
paulo747,25,19,Early Evening 'Afternoon Tea',[5.0],"It's one of those boxes that appears on many a Life's To Do List -' Afternoon Tea at The Ritz'. And so it should be. It really is an excellent experience. Walking in through those revolving doors you are immediately struck by an impression of occasion, a glimpse into a different world, a fairy-tale parallel universe.The architecture and décor is breath-taking, the opulence of it all borders on the bizarre, but that's why you are there in the first place right? The staff are immaculately presented and professionally courteous, polite and always seem happy to take your photo.The only reservation we could get was the last sitting at 7.30 which I first thought was a little too late, but actually it made perfect sense as it freed up the rest of the day for other things and we were able to make a very pleasant, unhurried evening of it. The 'Tea' itself was very good, it's difficult not to scoff the finger sandwiches at breakneck speed if you're feeling a bit peckish, but the scones will slow you down and the trifle was brilliant. Surprisingly you feel rather full quite quickly.It's all about absorbing the ambience, so drink it in along with your tea and tick that box.", May 2013, Travelled as a couple

I found a fabulous rate online and plans were made that did not disappoint.If you are a lover of traditional luxury and extraordinary service, give this old-world hotel a chance.  The front desk upgraded us to a lovely room (with fireplace, small sitting area and beautiful bathroom), concierge got us fabulous seats at two terrific productions, we had some fun times at the Rivoli Bar and each time we walked into the hotel lobby one of the staff members greeted us by name. The location is fantastic - just across Green Park from Buckingham Palace and steps away from every luxury named store in the world.  And, because of a strictly enforced dress code, we did not have to share our vacation with people attired for a hike in Idaho rather than a visit to London.We savored our time here and hope we have the good fortune to return.", April 2013, Travelled as a couple

Suffice it to say if you came away hungry it would have been entirely your own fault.  There was a choice of tea from breakfast tea to lapsang souchon and you drank as much or as little as you wanted.

TopTripie,111,73,Tea at The Ritz - efficient and unhurried.,[5.0],"It’s right that The Ritz insist on jackets and suits for gentlemen - it’s sets the perfect tone for this most British of occasions. As this is an extremely popular experience there are several “slots” to which the staff strictly adhere to especially as they reset every table with fresh linens in between sittings. The selection of teas is extremely comprehensive. The sandwiches beautifully fresh, the cakes contain just the right amount of richness and the scones are tasty and light. If you have room for the extra sandwiches and cakes that are instantly offered ( not to mention the trifle, lemon drizzle cake and Black Forest gateaux that are offered at the very end of the experience ) then you will have arrived with an appetite of generous proportions. The staff are attentive and efficient and nothing is too much trouble. Even when we were presented with our bill ( for extra Champagne and Brandy ) without asking for it, some time before our allotted time was up, we weren’t upset as the staff had been so smoothly professional that somehow ( as perhaps one might feel in another establishment ) we weren’t at all offended by their manner.We left feeling extremely satisfied.", May 2013, Travelled on business

sarah M,15,20,Worst day to stay!,[5.0],"We had booked the Ritz prior to our Orient Express departure and it happened to be the same day as THE funeral..  Thus, all rooms were occupied, the afternoon tea - usually sedate and refined, was HEAVING.However, our room was blissfully luxurious, and, whether this was a bonus or not, the restaurant was fully booked and we were reluctantly ushered through a locked door by liveried doormen (hardly bouncers) to the Private Members' Dining and Casino below.  This was quite an experience as the decor was belle epoque and of an age gone by and reminded me of the nights I had to spend at Mayfair casinos with my company's dignitaries and guest corporate officers.Clearly the dining was private.  I was discouraged with a curt remonstration for wanting to take a pic of the rich cornice work around the ceiling.  Other guests at the time appeared to be a table of very young suited Russian men, and a Middle or Far East dynasty with several generations who I tried to identify but just could not put the proverbial finger on it.  Of course we were read their riot act gently by professional young be-suited  attractive and articulate women re the entry to the casino which we decided not to respond to, neither committing ourselves to going in (never, not even if I had the cash as the atmosphere in casinos is weird - not exactly testosterone, but a bit primordial like the roar you get at the finish of a horse race which I find equally disturbing).The food and service was faultless and very good foie gras (would have been even better fried).  I only eat this when I can be sure of the source and assumed that the Ritz would have its long standing supplier.  The Dover Sole, huge and succulent, firm as it should be.  Very expensive really, but the surroundings were well worth experiencing..All in all a good night with a slight niggle about the chaos when our driver pulled up outside with luggage on our arrival;  I had quite forgotten the date.", April 2013, Travelled as a couple

But given the location and the competitive rates, I decided to give it a try. I couldn't have been happier with the staff and how nice they were to my children. During our stay, they bent over backwards with welcome gifts, ice cream and a ride around the park in the Ritz's Rolls Royce. Room Service had a reasonably priced children's menu, to boot. Unlike many hotels, I didn't feel that they were always looking to upcharge me for everything (internet and breakfast were included with our rates).

I have been to The Waldorf in London for afternoon tea and so have a comparison to go by. The staff were welcoming (unlike The Waldorf where check was a nightmare) but we were herded rather swiftly through the main dining area to a private room which actually made it feel more exclusive and the surroundings were fantastic. Not as much care and attention had been lavished on the actual tea as The Waldorf and it did seem a bit 'mass catering' but the food was OK, replenished often and the staff were very attentive. What made this an above average visit was the tour around the William Kent suite led by a very charming and knowledgeable young man.

deejayel,33,64,Expensive Breakfast !,[5.0],"Our room was not ready when we booked in and so we were shown to a hospitality room where we could relax, drink tea/coffee, use the bathroom and eat biscuits while we waited.  A short time later we were shown to our room, beautifully and luxuriously decorated, and unexpectedly large.  The location of course is perfect for shopping, visting and tourist activities.  Service excellent as expected.  This isn't really a criticism, because I knew in advance that the breakfast was £70 for two people.  This just seemed too expensive to me, especially since my wife normally just has a cup of coffee and slice of toast.  Bit then again I'm from the provinces and not used to London prices.  In any case I guess if you're staying in a suite at £1000+ per night then this is a drop in the ocean but for me it would have been almost 25% of the cost of the room.  I'm not really complaining, just to say that the room seemed good value for money but the breakfast seemed extortionate.  Maybe that should have a separate, cheaper breakfast room for us normal people.  Also I noticed that even to go to the bar in the evening required a reservation, which I thought was a bit over the top.  Just as a footnote there are plenty of places nearby to have breakfast so I wouldn't let that put you off staying.

You must first remember this is an historic hotel and its olde worlde charm is the point. From my initial booking the communication from staff confirming my stay was fantastic. On arriving I was warmly welcomed at the cab, check-in was quick and friendly and I was personally shown to my room and all the features explained. I had upgraded from the standard queen for more space. The furnishings and fittings are certainly getting older. The furniture looks antique, there is a stunning chandelier in the room and the bathroom looks like it belongs in a period drama, but everything works perfectly. Only the ageing air con unit was annoying, blowing hot air and seemingly unable to be altered despite my call to maintenance - they came promptly and were lovely but no real change ensued - so I finally turned it off. I had a drink in the Rivoli Bar and ordered room service. There is no tea or coffee in the room so that was disappointing, but tea was delivered in a proper silver pot so provided many more cups than i could drink alone. It's the Ritz so food and drinks are not cheap. Service was fast and faultless and excellent though from every single person. Everyone referred to me by name.The wifi is fast and easy, available free throughout the hotel. Turndown service before bed was so delightful that by now I was feeling like a queen. I was still in my room working and the maid quietly put my slippers by my feet before she left!!

@007snowbunny,109,93,the name has been put to shame,[1.0],"After staying at Browns Hotel in London,The Pulitzer Hotel in Amsterdam, Le Bristol in Paris, you get the idea of the quality I  expect from a hotel - 5 Star. You can see my ratings and reviews from stays all over the world, helping fellow  tripadvisor's in their travels.We checked in with a rather nasty woman on the front desk called Marie, who could do with a holiday, (we found out later she was up for annual leave, funny that), we asked in advance if we could have a  late check out at 6pm there is no problem with paying as we do this quite often as our flight was not till late that night, she replied in a snarly, unhelpful voice ""unfortunately i cannot accommodate that until the day"" (the day we check out). This would be too late as we have to make plans to stay at another hotel if they cannot accommodate or help with our request. We are not off to a good start, first impressions, and ""Marie"" was not one of them. The room was hot when we walked in, the concierge looked like he was attending to heating/cooling by the window hearing our ""hot"" comments, throughout our stay we figured out what he attended to- the air con doesn't actually work, it just blows room temp air, he also opened the window as this was the cooling system they use (fawlty Towers). looking out the window was the hot boilers for the building, disgusting. Our turndown service we had to ask  for, every other hotel has them already done from when you return from dinner. The sweet girl was so scared of losing her job, when we heard staff call her on the 2 way radio, why has she not done our room. I mentioned on checkout  to the more helpful gentleman  who could accommodate our wishes of a late check out, ""how good is the view from that room,"" his eyes immediately lit up for a second, then he realised we could see his thoughts in his eyes, a reality check--  oh its the room with air con that doesn't work, boilers outside the window, mould around the shower screens, see pictures (I could get it off with my exit mould and a hard brush, but i wasn't there to clean lol,) he was cool and got exactly where i was coming from. Its not all its cracked up to be. Here is a copy of  the email from The Ritz in response to our complaints:Dear Mr and Mrs W ,Thank you for your recent stay at The Ritz Hotel, I trust you had a safe journey back home and were able to enjoyed your overall time London.I sincerely apologise for the catalogue of errors you endured throughout your stay.

We do conduct our turndown service from 5.30pm until 11.00pm however in some circumstances I realise this may be too late. I have since taken the liberty of updating your profile to ensure, should you return, you will receive a turndown service at a more convenient hour.Mr and Mrs W, I completely understand your intention never to return to The Ritz given the experiences you had however, I would very much like the opportunity to show you the excellent and personalised service we at The Ritz are so internationally renowned for.

jdunkley55,148,63,Superb experience,[5.0],"We had lunch here recently on my husband's 60th birthday and, what can I say?  It was an experience neither of us will forget.  From arriving to leaving some 3.5 hours later we were impressed by the whole thing.  The food was a dream, the champagne gorgeous and the staff respectful.  We took my mother-in-law, who is nearly 89.  She had stayed with an aunt who was in service near the Ritz in the 1920's and 30's and used to watch the 'ladies in their pretty dresses' going in and out and wondered for the next 70 years what it was like inside.  She now knows and was not disappointed.  She is a lifelong vegetarian who, due to medical problems, cannot now eat peppers or onions (as we know these are a staple of most veggie dishes).  I contacted the Hotel prior to us going and was assured that the kitchen would be made aware of this.  When we got there, the waiter came to us and clarified that it was pepper the vegetable, and not pepper the condiment that she could not eat.  Detail!  A wonderful time, not rushed, attentive, but not overpoweringly so, staff.  All in all a highly recommended experience.  Lastly, did I mention that we were on Groupon vouchers?  No, it was not necessary to do so, we were treated in every conceivable way just the same as anyone else there!", March 2013, Travelled with family

The service was not in anyway intrusive or snooty (as Northerners we fear this) but was attentive nevertheless.  We ate and ate, we were offered extra sandwiches, teas and just when we felt fit to burst, a trolley with cakes, pannacottas and everything delicious was brought over.  We indulged... we were defeated!  Whilst a member of the waiting staff jokingly threatened to bring us more cake we rolled ourselves out after spending an hour and 3/4 in tea and cake heaven!The only thing we have to work out now is how do we ever top what we did for our first anniversary?", April 2013, Travelled as a couple

Silling,26,19,Amazing food and proper dancing,[5.0],We have been taking Latin and ballroom lesson for a couple of years and visted in December for a Ritz dinner dance with dancing to a live band. The setting was magical and the set menu was devine although we did decline the champagne to start at £95 a bottle. We had about 7 courses in all and the band played a great variety of real dance music so we could get up and dance between each course although the dance was a little small so we had to fight a bit for space. A real treat but not cheap at £300 for 2 people., December 2012, Travelled as a couple

popLondon,133,77,Amazing dinner at the Ritz,[5.0],"My wife and I went to the Ritz for dinner expecting something good but not sure how good it might be. From the time we got into the Ritz it oozed class and possibly for some people this would be too posh but for such a special place it was well worth the experience. We had dinner vouchers and there was a mix up with vendor who was meant to give us to ticket stubs and we only received one by mail but once the initial hurdle was sorted we got started with a glass of champagne as part of the package. Some amazing petit four to start really got the juices going and we realised this was going to be a really good meal experience. The wine list is quite expensive but then all good hotels are sadly pricey on their alcohol. TIP: If you want 2-3 glasses per person then always best to get a bottle.Our starter was the quail and salmon which we found sublime, my wife said her salmon was the best she ever had and my quail was really delicious but best of all were the accompanying sides which were really tasty, well presented, and stylish. Our mains were the pork belly and halibut, again well presented, tasty lovely presentation even though I found the pork belly a to look like a brick (but layered and nicely presented possibly could have been done in a different way). My wife normally never has pork belly due to it's accompanying fat content but she loved it (almost no fat, all pork)... My Halibut was juicy and tasty and a good portion all round.We both tried the Chocolate Souffle which we had seen served to other guests all evening around us and thought it looked amazing, but would the taste live up to the look. Well I can say it certainly did. Very light, perfectly baked, the milk ice cream was simple yet perfect. My wife was full so I finished her last bite off very easily.We had some tiny post dessert accompaniments as well just to fill us up even more which were sublime but we couldn't finish then and there so a lovely Ritz box was supplied with our left overs to take home.. :-)Service was excellent, all the staff were friendly and helpful, timing was perfect. They all worked very well together and seemed to enjoy the table waiting.All in all an amazing experience and I would definitely come here again in future for dinner. Please note it requires a tie for men so basically a suit it is sort of expected when dining at the Ritz.", April 2013, Travelled as a couple

There were some more over the top but any day dress that's not too short or a skirt and blouse would be fine. Heels not needed. The food was beautiful- a selection of sandwhiches followed by fresh scones, they brought round cake to chose from as well as a stunning panacotta followed by petit fours and macaroons. We had the ritz royal tea ( as one must when at the ritz!) and then the lemon tea which was so tasty and refreshing. Just a note, fortnam and masons is down the road which is lovely carry on the experience and get some luxury goods however this is not open on Sunday's!

Waking up on the Saturday morning to find a large Christmas tree in the lobby, beautifully decorated, was a marvelous surprise.The only issue I had was that the telephone in the bedroom to the front desk had a bad connection and it was difficult to hear; however that is no real consideration on what was, in total, a fantastic stay.The location is perfect; with an underground station close by, Piccadilly Circus a moment's walk away and Green Park pretty much on the door step.

The js and the bathroom were as nice as ever. Only, they had replaced the Bulgari toiletries with some unknown ones. What a dissappointment for us two ladies! We had some tea and scones from the room service before going to the Rivoli bar. The order was not complete and a wrong tea was delivered. No big deal, but this is the Ritz...We had some glasses of champagne and something to eat in the Rivoli bar, which has a nice and lively ambience.We had breakfast in the main dinig room, which is magnificent. The breakfast is still a bit limited for a hotel of this caliber, I think.They charge you for the Times.

money7521,12,13,One of the Last Grand Hotels in the World,[5.0],"When I frist booked this hotel for the price I was paying per night, I could not understand how it would ever be worthwhile. But after my family's six night stay in February, I believe the experience was worth every penny. The only way to describe this hotel is decadent. It is decorated like no other hotel I can think of (The Plaza in New York comes close). It has gold crusted ceilings, a grand staircase leading up to the rooms, lifts with hand painted murals, fresh cut flowers filling the lobby with a wonderful floral aroma, ladies and gents dressed in jackets with coattails, the list keeps going. The check-in process was quite smooth with hot towels offered upon arrival. Our room was not ready when we arrived since we had a 9 AM flight into Heathrow, but the upgrade they offered for being Leaders Club members was more than worth the wait. It should be noted that the hotel does have a dress code for breakfast where sneakers (trainers) are banned along with shorts. Dinner is a jacket and tie affair. The staff was nice enough to relax this rule when we arrived since we were a mess after a seven hour plane ride from JFK. When our room was ready at around 2PM, the person from the front desk came to the lounge and escorted us to the Park Suite on the seventh floor. The room was gorgeous with crystal chandeliers, green and pink carpeting, fresh roses and orchids, and a very large walk in closet for the bedroom. The view was gorgeous as well, looking over Green Park down Piccadilly. The only letdown was the bathroom and its phone booth sized shower. You have to be under 5'4"" to fit comfortably in there. If they would just install a shower head holder in the bathtub, since it already had a glass door, it would make the bathing experience much less claustrophobic. Side note, they still use regular keys to keep with the style of the hotel. It works well because the staff asks you to deposit your key with the concierge (hall porters) every time you leave the hotel. It makes it less likely that you will lose the key. Plus the concierge somehow always remembered our faces, names, room number, and what we did for the day.But the best feature of this hotel were the staff members, they were the best compared to anywhere else my family has stayed. Service is an art form here. The staff is not there to act like snobby, well to do butlers. Though I am sure if you want them to play that role, they would be more than happy to. Instead, the staff is incredibly friendly, always willing to give advice about what to do for the day, where to eat, what to see, tube directions, etc. Our family frequently used the concierge for dinner reservations and they always had good suggestions if what we wanted was not available. If it were not for them, we would have never gone to Le Caprice, one of our better meals during the trip. We did ask the concierge for SIM cards for our phones and they were more than happy to oblige. We did not want to pay egregious data charges for looking at Google Maps every day. For 15 GBP per card with a plan, the price was right. Location, its in the middle of London between Mayfair and St. James with a tube stop right next door. Not much more you could ask for. In the end, it was an absolute delight for us to stay at the Ritz.

Fluke5,12,16,Simply Incomparable.,[5.0],"I don't believe there are enough superlatives to adequately describe a stay at The Ritz. Our family of five - three teenage daughters - had travelled all around England (we are Australian) for 8 weeks and our final two nights were to be spent in London at The Ritz. As it was by then early December, we had booked afternoon tea for a nice winter Christmas experience - something unheard of in our warm climate.We stayed in mostly wonderful accommodation all over and had some very high standards, but truly nothing could come close to this one. We had stayed on our first two nights at another very highly regarded premier hotel in London and while we loved it, The Ritz just exceeded every expectation. From the friendly doorman (who remembered  my name from the first minute on), to the lovely check in staff, to the impeccable waiting staff at breakfast I was completely captivated. The Christmas tree upon entry was enough to stoke every childhood Christmas fantasy one could have - and the decorations were superb. A walk through the lobby and into the hall that leads to Palm Court and the dining room was like a walk in Victorian fairyland - Christmas trees everywhere, decorated in vivid reds and gold, with silver tea sets as deocrations and the most glorious flower arrangements. Our room was a dream - we had booked adjoining Junior suites and they were stunning. Upon arrival we discovered a gift addressed to our youngest daughter, who is 12. It was a giftwrapped and boxed jigsaw puzzle of the hotel - it was just beautiful and has made a wonderful momento of the trip. We were so touched by this thoughtful gesture to make children feel welcome.Nothing we requested during our stay was a problem, and everything was taken care of in the most professional, yet friendly manner. Breakfast was wonderful and the food was fresh and beautifully cooked and presented. The highlight of course, was afternoon tea on our second day. We entered Palm Court and swept up the small staircase into the most beautifully decorated area - piles of giftwrapped boxes adorned the stairs and garlands were wrapped around the columns. We were seated and presented with tea (of course) and offered champagne. In due course a selection of beautiful cakes and sweet treats appeared, with the middle tier empty. We were told this was for our scones - so they would be served at the correct temperature. They came soon after - honestly, I ate so many scones in England but these were something else. We were presented a little later with Christmas cake served from a trolley and small fruit mince pies - for a family of Aussies who usually are surrounded by BBQ's and summer parties at Christmas this was SUCH an experience. The finishing touch was the choir, who entered and sang with a pianist - not Jingle Bells or anything kitchy; traditional hymns like ""Oh Holy Night"" sung with the voices of angels. The whole experience was sublime and our entire family was enraptured.At the end of this lovely afternoon, one of the waiters came over and presented the three girls (despite them all being in their teens) with a Ritz teddy bear each - a surprising and beautiful finish to a memorable afternoon. Our cup runneth over!Leaving London in early December at night, driving through the streets just captivated by the lights and deocrations everywhere was an experience we will ever remember. But The Ritz Hotel, with it's fantastic staff and unmatched attention to detail will remain the highlight of a wonderful holiday. It truly is a perfect balance between elegance and friendliness, and it is our hope that we can return to this magnificent place. Our heartfelt thanks to the staff and management who made our stay so pleasureable, you are being highly recommended to all and sundry!", December 2012, Travelled with family

I stayed here for Christmas and was just overwhelmed by the Ritz. First impressions do count and I was bowled over when entering the palatial lobby with it's timeless decor and plush furnishings. I stayed in the Trafalgar Suite which is just out of this World. Other reviewers have said that the rooms are in need of update but I cannot see how? The rooms are of classic taste and this is the joy of The Ritz. My room was exceptionally clean, comfortable and luxurious. I would recommend spending extra and enjoying a Suite. On Christmas Eve I had Afternoon Tea in the Palm Court and can safely say that is the best tea I have had. The selection of finger sandwiches were prepared to perfection and the scones and cakes were so fresh and exquisite. From other reviews I have read, a few people have said that the atmosphere of the hotel is snobby and unless you wear certain clothes you will not fit in. I don't understand why these people chose the Ritz if they did not like this? It is an elegant building and I would be quite upset if people did not make the effort.

The famous concierge had  never heard of the cocktail bar we were meeting friends at just five minutes away.  The room was so cold that night i had to put my coat over us just to keep warm. When i mentioned this in the morning i was given the usual scripted apology no eye contact and i walked away feeling very let down and quite sad.The Ritz now seems to be a money making exercise with there afternoon teas even the breakfast was a let down.

It was everything I thought it would be plus about a million little surprises. It is fancy. It's probably snobby. It's expensive. It's glorious. Is it for every year? Probably not. Is it worth a milestone or a once-in-a-lifetime? ABSOLUTELY. Do go for a suite -- it's amazing. Do join and go to the Ritz Cub -- it's fantastic. Do eat the food -- it's second to none. Do befriend the staff -- they are precious. Do walk all around the place, see it all. Go up, go down, ask to see the old basement, see the Club, have breakfast in the dining room, have a drink or dessert in the bar. Sit. Observe. Take it all in. It's not trendy.... it's not hip.... it's not what the teens would appreciate. Brush up on your manners, refresh your mind on extended place settings.

Superb scones, and very nice pastries completed the cakestand. The tea was of the finest quality, and the service outstanding. The only downside is that men have to wear a jacket and tie, though you would look out of place if you didn't.The waiters could snoot for England, and the place is just like what you would imagine The Ritz would be. Everyone should do this at least once in their life, though it is the most expensive afternoon tea I have ever had, by a long way.The only negative was some jobsworth at the door telling me I couldn't take a measly photo of my wife in the foyer for some unknown reason.

We were shown to our table by a chap who actually seemed to glide across the room!   We decided to try various teas as we are big tea drinkers at home and they were all wonderful.  Two three tier cake stands were brought to the table with various delicious fingers of gorgeous sandwiches. Then two three tier cake stands full of beautiful pastries and another two of warm fruit and plain scones with pots of jams and clotted cream!  Definately a day to forget about the diet!  We could not eat all.  My hubby is not a cake person but even he tried some and agreed they were delicious.  The surroundings are magnificent and opulent.  One elelgant chap came over (I think he was the head waiter), with more pastries on a trolley which we didnt try but he was friendly and chatted to us for a bit and answered some of our questions about the hotel and gave us some interesting facts about it too.  It is a wonderful experience for a special treat.  There was a family next to us and they brought out a birthday cake for the mum and played happy birthday on the grand piano and everyone clapped.

We expected the staff to be haughty and intimidating but nothing could have been more misguided; without exception they were warm and welcoming. The room was retero luxury but the bathroom a bit worn. There is a safe in the room and free wi-fi, both expected of any good hotel but not always there. The bar is atmospheric, classical art-deco, cosy and warm. Drinks are horrendously expensive, but that's to be expected; about £20 for a cocktail and for a glass of wine. The cocktails were great, the wine by the glass of very poor quality. The dining room is just beautiful; the waiters are helpful and the service impeccable. The food is ""fancy"", ravioli was in fact a ravioli! but it was good. The main course disappointed, meagre portions. Nevertheless the meal overall was very good indeed. Wine was not as expensive as expected, but the cheapest on the list,about £55, included a very acceptable Chablis. The cost of dinner normally about £65 for the evenings menu was inflated to £100 because it was a dinner-dance night - not to our taste and something of an imposition for a one night stay.

In fact it was so large, when the waiter came with the trolley for dinner in our suite, we could not hear him knocking at the front door.  It was that far away from the living room.

Jacquiamee,15,12,A mixed coctail,[4.0],"I see that most reviews for The Ritz are glowing with five stars.  We were given a night by a colleague as a treat during December.  The hotel was decked out like a fairy story, a fantasy delight for Christmas.  Our room was wonderful, opulent and comfortable.  Alas, our dining experiences were not so good.  A club sandwich of salt beef was packed with meat but it was too chewy and heavy going.  The Rivoli bar has plenty of 1920s atmosphere although the carpet looks worn.   My mint julep cocktail was heavy with ice and rather insipid I thought.  Our evening meal in the dining room was much anticipated and the room looked gorgeous with two big glittering Christmas trees glimpsed on the terrace.  We chose from the £50 three course menu.  My partridge was (once again) less than tender, although my companion’s halibut was light and lovely.  The dishes are nouvelle cuisine sizes apart from desert.  The chestnut soufflé was delicious.  I ordered a glass of house red but it was not pleasant, I caught sight of the waiter taking a swig from a glass before bringing the bottle to me:  I assumed to see if it was suitable to serve - it was not a five star gesture to be honest.  The petit fours were scrumptious but we weren’t asked if we wanted coffee and had to attract the attention of a rather indifferent waiter to request it.  We had a good night’s sleep in our luxurious room enjoying a lie-in.   Breakfast is served until 11am.  We arrived at around 10am and were asked to sit outside while a table was prepared.  They clearly then forgot about us since we sat there until 10.30.  Finally inside the dining room there were only a handful of guests remaining.  The buffet bar looked rather tired so I ordered a cooked breakfast at £35 assuming that it would be prepared fresh.  The eggs clearly were fresh but the bacon and sausage had obviously been hanging around for some time.  The bacon was like leather and the sausage was tough and dry.  I didn’t complain at the time since our colleague, a Ritz devotee, was footing much of the bill and it seemed ungracious to do so.  All in all, our stay was memorable but I would think twice about eating here again.", December 2012, Travelled with friends

The staff replenished all sandwiches and pastries regularly. You certainly do not need to have lunch prior to arriving. We had requested no big sandwiches and instead we had hommous.It was extremely busy and rather noisy.We did have a harpist that played wonderfully.It was a truly lovely experience and we are glad we went.On the negative side. We were never asked if we required our tea to be replenished.We felt that although the two hour slot was sufficient the staff did start to rush you a little.  Once our sandwiches had been taken away our bill was immediately brought to us placed on the table and within five minutes the staff were back to collect it. We still had 45 minutes of our 2 hour slot left.All in all it was a lovely afternoon, January 2013,nan
sem31,9,10,Afternoon tea at the Ritz,[5.0],"On planning our girlie weekend  away just before Christmas, we decided that afternoon tea at the Ritz would be a shear indulgence that we had to experience.  Although we were booked in for 7.30 on a Saturday evening it didn't matter.  What an experience it was, to sum it up in one word ""AMAZING"".Right from stepping through the doors of this hotel to leaving, we were surrounded by such oppulence and grandure that it brought tears to not only my eyes but those of the other 5 girlies, there was a large christmas tree just at the entrance that must have been 80ft tall, all lit up.  We were shown to the tearoom which again was full of grandure and our table, which was set up as you would expect for afternoon tea was exquisite.  The staff were all dressed in their livelry which cant have changed much from days gone by, very veryfriendly and courteous  and attentive at all times.  The champagne that we had was lovely and as for the cakes, scones, cotted cream and jam,mince pies and sandwiches, ooh what a delight, I have never tasted anything like it, the waiter also came round with more sandwiches if you required them and also a cake trolly .  With it being christmas the pianist played christmas carols and to top it all off a group of singers also sang carols.  I would highly recommend anyone wanting to try the Ritz for 'afternoon tea'  go for it if only just for the experience.  To pardon the pun it rounded our trip to London off as the cherry on the cake.", December 2012, Travelled with friends

Normally I don't sleep well in any hotel despite the star rating......noise, beds, pillows, too hot, strange place etc....but this one night I stopped I slept the best I ever had in any other hotel including other 5* establishments! The bed was comfortable, the pillows perfect, temperature in the room was lovely & the bathroom spotless (& I'm a nurse so I mean spotless to my exacting high standards!). There was a feel to the rooms & corridors that I can't put into words....but lets just say I felt comfotable walking round the hotel as if I have stayed many times before & felt at home!I feel for what was provided for accomadation it's worth the price, the only thing I will say was I did think breakfast was a little pricy, fantastic but myself & my family had decided to have breakfast on the train as we were travelling first class back home on an am train but Sunday morning we all woke up starving & decided to have it in the hotel instead. So maybe next time I would book B&B.... & there will be a next time as I recommend The Ritz Hotel to anybody stopping in London. Thank you Ritz Hotel, we came because it was to celebrate out daughters 21st by going to see Lion King....getting a date where all four of us could go was difficult & it ended up being 8mths later but the birthday cake in her room from you, the fantastic service you gave us & your lovely hotel made for a perfect weekend!", January 2013, Travelled with family

The restaurant is splendid looking, and a wonderful experience to be in, but the food was overly complicated and a bit disapppointing.  It tries too hard to be innovative, to invent new and different combinations; they need a few simpler, well-cooked dishes as well.  If you want to go for afternoon tea (which looks like a meal in itself), which we didn't, you should know that you must book quite far in advance.

Secondly the room we stayed in on our third trip needed to have the beds separated and remade, we had specified a twin before arrival, but were huffed at by the maid as if we were putting her out. We did it ourselves the next day after it was remade in the morning as a double. Overall I wouldn't stay here again but I'm happy to have had the experience.

discerningNJ,48,81,"Formal, Old-World Elegance",[5.0],"We stayed at the Ritz the week before Christmas 2012 and it was a memorable experience.  The staff is wonderful, especially the head Hall Porter, Michael, and the doorman, also named Michael. An earlier reviewer talked about trying to be persuaded at check in to take a much more expensive accommodation than requested.  This also happened to us.  We looked but stayed with our Junior Suite which was large and magnificently furnished.  The room decor is so French that I had to remind myself I was not in Paris when inside our room. Original gold gilt moldings and chandelier from 1906 are part of the furnishings.  The bathrooms have been redone and are large with  beautiful marble.  We stayed in 2 different suites as we split our week up with a short stay at Chewton Glen in the middle. (See review) Both our suites were gorgeous.Especially wonderful was our Saturday evening of dinner dancing at the Ritz Restaurant.  It was really a throwback to another era and we loved every minute of it.  The room is one of the most beautiful anywhere, the food was haute cuisine, service fabulous and the ballroom dancing to a four piece band so much fun. We stayed the whole evening from 7:00 until after midnight as did the whole crowd there.  Many were dressed in tuxedos, but cocktail dress and suit and ties were also very appropriate. As others have said, the location in Mayfair can't be beat especially if you want to be within walking distance of Buckingham Palace and so many other royal sights. The shopping on Piccadilly, and New and Old Bond Streets is so much fun and the nearby restaurants are fabulous.  Michael made all our dinner reservations and we dined superbly on his recommendations.I highly recommend this hotel for those who want the absolute best in luxury and service.  However The Ritz is old-world elegance, so if you want luxury with a contemporary feel, another choice would be better.  But this is London at its grandest.", December 2012, Travelled as a couple

We certainly didn’t feel like second class guests just because we stayed in the cheapest room available.

The Christmas decorations were beautiful and each evening, there will be music played along the corridors just opposite the area where their famous afternoon tea is being served at the Palm Tea Court.  The service here is good with the reception area staff being really friendly and nice and the concierge staff are also very helpful with tour arrangements and directions.  Throughout our stay, we have been greeted by the staff each morning and evening.  The rooms are surprisingly spacious and luxurious and the location of the hotel is convenient.  Most bus tours including the double decker ""hop on hop off"" buses stop just at the back of the Ritz.  So getting onto tours and transportation is rather convenient.  The Green Park is just behind the hotel and Oxford Street is just a short 10 minutes walk away.  The Green Park tube station is also 5 minutes walk away.  Just opposite the road, there are a few shops such as M&S and Cafe Nero where you can pick up a sandwich or coffee.I would definitely recommend staying at the Ritz and experience this old world charm hotel.", November 2012, Travelled on business

From the time we arrived and were taken care of so well at reception, to the time we checked out. The lobby and Palm Tea Court were decorated exquisitely. It was like a Christmas Wonderland. Lovely carolers were singing every time we returned home to the hotel. You are handed your very heavy old fashioned key and off to your room you go. BTW, you can store your key with the hotel when you go out, so you don't have to lug it around. We stayed in an Executive King room and it was extremely spacious. Loved the black out shades that rolled down at the touch of a button by the bed. Each time we returned to our room, there was something waiting for us. Champagne, mince meat pies, a lovely stocking filled with fruit and nuts, Chocolates. For a small fee, they even set up a Christmas tree in our room for us! We enjoyed a fabulous Christmas Tea in the Palm Court - lovely to see Father Christmas come around with little bears for the little ones.

Everything with regards to customer service is opulently discreet. Yes, the up-selling you get in every business, but saying 'no' seemed easier and continued to be treated as a guest in their home. If you entertain pleasant acceptance of the fact it is going to cost a lot of money, the experience is well worth the relaxing oasis from the turmoil of London. The restaurant is staffed by consummate, knowledgeable professionals with natural, personal training, as opposed to learnt from a classroom. Again, as in any business, you will get the one who doesn't want to be there, but they don't stick around, and in The Ritz you can do something about it with no fuss.

MrsSW,168,104,A Very Special Hotel,[5.0],"My husband and I were treated by our daughter and son in law, who recently got married and wanted to thank us for everything to one of the Ritz Voucher Packages. We were so overwhelmed and excited as I've often talked about the famous tea at the Ritz.  From the minute we arrived we enjoyed every second. Our package was for bed and breakfast and the four course cabaret dinner dance  which is on every saturday night in the Ritz Restaurant. Once we checked in we were shown to our room which overlooked Green Park, the room was lovely as we're all the Bathroom amenities, fluffy bathrobes, fluffy towels etc. We went to the Rivoli bar for drinks and cocktails, very pricey £125 for 2 mohitos and 3 whiskey and dry. We we re joined by a friend for drinks! But saying that the ambience was very special. Dinner in the restaurant was interesting, we chose from the four course set menu. Not everybody's cup of tea food wise and we are well travelled in rating in top restaurants around the world but the service was second to none and we enjoyed the dancing.  Wonderful breakfast the next day, again served in the beautiful Ritz restaurant and of course no stay at the Ritz would be complete without experiencing the famous afternoon tea which we treated our daughter and son in law to. It was everything and more . Lavish and decadent. We enjoyed everything and of course it was the perfect way to end our wonderful weekend at the Ritz.

Lally6019,102,63,Great Value Weekend,[5.0],"We booked one of The Ritz's weekend break deals - Highgrove Shopping Experience. We wondered whether the reality of a hotel with such a reputation would live up to the hype, but in fact we were totally blown away by the warmth and efficiency of all of the staff. The room was lovely and our package included dinner and breakfast - both excellent. The Highgrove Shopping experience was a real treat as we were whisked to Clarence House in a fleet of Jags for a leisurely champagne-fuelled Christmas shopping session. We were made to feel very special indeed. I wouldn't normally pay so much for a hotel but, I have to say, it was worth every penny and we had a lovely relaxing break. My only quibble was why charge for wi-fi in the rooms. Seems ridiculous these days especially when every other luxury is provided. Other than that tiny point, excellent value break and we'd definitely stay again.", November 2012, Travelled as a couple

Fussy-Mac,24,19,Afternoon Tea,[5.0],"I recently visited The Ritz for afternoon tea to celebrate a friend's 50th birthday.I had booked last minute after reading some very encouraging reviews. Upon arrival we were greeted and shown to a table in the very regal looking Palm Restaurant. The tables were dressed perfectly with white linen, pristine china and silver tea service.  This really had the wow factor and should be reserved for very special occasions. We sat down to a scrumptious tea with champagne. The cakes were a mixture of exotic looking patisseries as well as a choice of slab cakes with of course the traditional lovely warmed scones and although the sandwich fillings did not appear to be anything too special they certainly tasted special with the quality of the ingredients and the little twist they added to a rather basic filling.  The waiters were especially attentive and you just could not fault them.The best thing was for the duration the waiters ensured we were thoroughly looked after and replenished our plates throughout.Table seatings are one and a half hours to one and three quarter hours and although this may not seem long in reality it is quite adequate. This is very formal service and we found the time to be quite sufficient. Although we did sit their until the last and the waiters never made us feel as though we should leave.This is definitely a special occasion; quality food ,quality service, beautiful decor (definitely bring your camera) and of course all this is going on whilst listening to the sound of the beautiful piano in the background.We all thoroughly enjoyed dressing up for the day, being waited on and made to feel special and of course very welcome.", September 2012, Travelled with friends

boatbuddy2007_12,60,54,Don't be fooled by  pretty looks without the details that make a 5 Star,[3.0],"I just returned and sent the Manager a series of comments starting with being overchaged for the room. For some reason they can't take the AX quoted fee for three nights (fourth night was free) and divide by 4 when charging. This was pointed out but in advance and again at checkout they still got it wrong.  I am waiting for a 200+ GBP credit.The charge for internet access was 26 GBP per day. Is there any hotel in the world that charges more? Also a 10% surcharge for a 90 GBP car from the airport and theatre tickets?How about a 26 GBP Classic Club sandwich that consisted of three small cubes? Other 5 diamond hotels in the US charge a max of $18 or 12 GBP.Thankfully there is a great restaurant next door, the Wolseley where most items are less than 50% of The Ritz charges and you don't need a jacket or tie. Mind you I knew the dress code but was happy to pay much less and get more energy across the street.A missed wake up call, failure to tell guests that one of the outlets lets you charge US devices, incorrect charges for the mini-bar and a host of other problems makes this ""so called"" 5 star property wishing that I stayed at ""41"" or the Milestone.", November 2012, Travelled solo

Had a very disappointing start as despite giving an arrival time to the hotel, and turning up at the stated time we had to wait 1hr for our room to be ready. We were shown to a unused bedroom where we could help ourselves to tea and coffee and told we would be collected when the room was ready. We were given the impression it would be about 10-15 minutes, but it actually turned out to be an hour. Had we have been kept informed we would have gone out and returned to check in later, but there was no communication we even returned to the desk to see how much longer it would be but the lady dealing with us wasn't there and the other person couldn't help us. When someone finally showed us to our room we recieved no apology. Even when we enquired if there was a problem because we had been waiting an hour no compensation was offered. This was not an experiance that made us feel special, very disappointing.When we finally got there, the room itself was beautiful. I have nothing negative to say about the room, or in fact the hotel itself. The surroundings were sumptuous and beautiful. we really enjoyed our stay. The afternoon tea, and breakfast the next day were both amazing.Overall a lovely stay but the poor check in left me feeling cheated. We paid too much money for that kind of welcome.

Yes, you will spend a mininum of $NZ40 but it will be a fabulous experience at a truly iconic establishment; the waiters are perfectly attentive in absurdly white uniforms; the cocktails are quite delicious and the glass-ware simply elegant; the complementary olives and nuts are magnificently more-ish; and the ghosts of stylish drinkers from days gone by hover.  Then there are the bathrooms... don't have too many cocktails because you will want to walk gracefully past the busy dining room to experience for women, at least, a charming, immaculate and surprisingly serene space.

Kenny McLeod,164,147,Out of Date,[2.0],"So, the whole dress code thing:  Ritz ""prides itself"" on imposing a dress code on it's guests and there are many who enjoy that level of snobbery - I'm not one of them, beware this WILL impact on your stay when you spend a shed-load of cash to stay in a ""world famous"" landmark hotel, don't expect that they will offer a world-class service that you'll never forget, certainly I came away fairly irate at their lack of common courtesy and attentiveness.  Oh, I did read before I went on about the dress code, but still, when you come back from a long day of sightseeing in London, are you truly expected to return in shirt, trousers & jacket?  Really?  When I come back in 'casual wear' the staff (who should be there to serve you) should make more of an effort to make me feel like a valued guest, not like something that they've scraped from the bottom of their shoes.  Hard to know where to begin, stayed here in the summer for 3 nights with my daughter and had a very poor experience, won't be back.  I've stayed in considerably better properties in London (Savoy, JW Marriott, Claridges) which cost a similar amount and I found the following to be true of these other properties:Savoy treat you as their guest Grosvenor Square security people don't make you feel like a criminalClaridges don't have a ludicrous dress codeThe above staff are there to serve you - not to look down their noses at youThe above rooms are to a good standardIf these sound like fairly basic requirements when you are spending hundred (thousands) of pounds, my advice is to avoid The Ritz.  The room we were in was old and worn, a little musty too, the staff either condescend or interrogate you, if you dare to wear a polo shirt & shorts during a particularly hot London day (yes folks, it *does* happen once in a while) you will be frowned upon and refused access to all of the hotel public areas.The high-tea was ok, but nothing to write home about, I even understand the faffing with jacket and tie to be fair, happy to respect that kind of tradition in this type of setting - for an hour or so, not for 3 days of 'down time' when on holiday.  The breakfast was superb and the breakfast room stunning.  However, whilst I was instructed to wear a shirt and trousers to breakfast, it rather appears that a Japanese woman who had an incredibly important phone call to make was not asked to respect those around her by the Ritz staff as she proceeded to babble what I can only assume was inane drivel for the entire duration of our breakfast to some poor sap on the other end of her call - should I really (really?) have to ask the waiter to have a word, they were able to hear her in Basildon!  So, this arrogant behaviour is fine - just make sure you have a long-sleeved shirt on.So, as you'd expect, my recommendation (honestly) is to avoid this place if you are wanting to go and enjoy all London has to offer, The Savoy do it all SO much better and you aren't frowned upon should you be something of a rebel and try to enter a bar with a polo-shirt on!", July 2012, Travelled with family

panter,586,142,Glitz & Gold but not Practical,[4.0],"We booked this hotel through AmEx who offered a a great deal for the room which included breakfast.  The reviews are correct.   Sort of.  The ""Proper Ritz"" as the Londoners call it, think old world charm, Titanic, Afternoon Tea, breakfast and breakfast room - all over the top. If I based this review on the Ritz's old world glamour, this would be a five star review.  We were in a top floor junior suite with a small juliette  balcony. You were not able to open the french windows of the balcony as they were secured shut with alarm wires and could only be opened the few inches the wires would allow.  Ordinarily, this would not be a problem.  However, it was quite warm when we visited and the a/c in our room was noisy and didn't get very cold.  Our room was large and the bathroom beautiful, but there were few receptacles in the suite and none in the bathroom which had the only usuable mirror.  This made it very difficult to wash and dry your hair.  In order to charge cell phones, a necessary light had to be unplugged.  Lastly, we found the mattress way to soft to be very comfortable.  All things considered, it was a good experience of glitz, gold and old world charm and deserves four stars.

harblinger,0,0,A masterclass in old school hospitality,[5.0],"I've read reviews on here from people criticising The Ritz for it's dress code policy. And I must confess I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but after a few minutes in the building I ""got it"". A stay at the Ritz is not like staying at the Four Seasons or any other modern 5 star hotel. A stay at the Ritz is an experience and like any experience it's always better if you dress for the part!From the moment we crossed the threshold we were made to feel welcome by the courteous staff. Check-in was conducted swiftly, followed by a brief tour of the hotel by an obviously proud member of staff before being taken up to our room. The room was spacious and immaculately decorated. Plenty of hanging space in the wardrobes, a well stocked mini-bar and a very, very comfy bed. The bathroom is scrupulously clean with a large bath which is ideal for having a good soak in. This stay came as close to perfect as I think it is practical to get. It's not perfect and if you really, really want to find something wrong you will. My only true criticism is that the only way to get 'free' internet was to use their laptop in the hospitality lounge. In this day and age, if I can get it free in McDonald's I do not expect to have to pay for it in a 5 star hotel. But then the Ritz is not unique in this, it seems all the major 5 star hotels in London do this. At the end of the day, I could get online without additional charge and it was only a minor inconvenience, I wasn't there to surf the 'net and there are plenty of other far more interesting things to do in the hotel than that (the Rivoli bar is well worth a look)", November 2012, Travelled as a couple

TRGSharnford,0,0,Lunch at the Ritz is not to be missed.,[5.0],"For a retirement present my daughters bought me lunch at the Ritz.  I have to say I was not really looking forward to it as I imagined stuffy service and that I would be uncomfortable there or rather made to feel uncomfortable there and I was putting off going . Also if you have never been you do not know how rigid the dress code is apart from the requirement to have a tie, jacket and no jeans. However as the voucher was soon to run out my wife said we are going and we did.  And I'm so glad we did. All my preconceptions were wrong. As for the dress code, yes you have to have a tie but if you come without one the cloakroom has a varied selection you can borrow    The dining room is, as you would expect, on the grand scale. Whilst the atmosphere is formal it is not stuffy and  the service is attentive, precise yet friendly. The food is excellent. The menu had a choice of 2 starters, mains and deserts with canapes before the starters. We decided to have one of each course. The starters were new season peas soup with truffled quail egg ravioil and marinated scallop and pigs head and Alexanders, a vegetable I had never had before. Main courses were John Dory with morels and Jersey Royals and Navarin of Lamb with new season garlic and turnip. The deserts were apricot souffle with almond ice cream and poached rhubarb with lime meringue and bergamot cream. We finished off the meal with coffee and their delicious chocolates, an extra charge,   My wife enjoyed them immensely and was delighted when we were offered more.  For a £100 for the two of us I think the meal was excellent value.  As for drinks  you could spend as much or as little as you wanted. You were not pressurized into having wine indeed, quite a few diners  just had water. However, we had champagne, £22 per glass and asked the wine waiter to bring a glass of wine to go with the starters and then the main courses. Our drinks bill came to over £110.  But that was our choice and we enjoyed them.  We had a thoroughly enjoyable time and will certainly go again.", May 2012, Travelled as a couple
Armaniexeter,0,0,Welcome to Titanic,[5.0],"""Welcome to Titanic"". This was my son's comment when two doormen opened the massive doors to the hall leading to the ""Palm Court"", the  place where evening tea with cucumber sandwich is the purest expression of the most well known British snob tradition.We arrived home yesterday after spending three days in London watching theBarclays ATP Tennis Master  semifinals and final between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. Having stayed at The Dorchester and the Berkley in London, and having experienced stays in other Ritz Carlton Hotels including The Ritz Hotel in Madrid I decided to opt for The Ritz in London.1910-1920's rococo style is just unique to Ritz from the decor to all staff uniforms and certainly it gives you the same feel as when Leonardo Di Caprio wearing his borrowed tails walks into the ""first class"" common rooms at the Titanic.Our room matched our expectations: marble, gold and all the Ritz trimmings. All the commodities resembled the expected decor with modern touches such a a Sony plasma TV.We had breakfast in the same room as what later on in the day becomes the Ritz's restaurant. This was possibly the only disappointing aspect of the whole Ritz experience. Twice we had to wait outside the room  for a table. The first time this was handled in a magnificent way by the mainbreakfast room supervisor when he kindly escorted us to the one of the main hall tables where we were served tea with some delicious cinnamon shortbread whilst waiting. Once the table was ready we were escorted back by the same member of staff in an impecable manner. The following day we encountered the same problem as once again the breakfast room was full. This time we were just asked to wait in the hall were all the tables were already taken. After 30 minutes (we were told a couple of minutes wait), no tea this time, the same young lady asked two other people who were also waiting and us to join her to go back to the breakfast room. Although she asked  of us to join her, she eventually  escorted the other couple to their table so we decided to just wait at the edge of the tables as we already have been told to follow her and she already had our room number noted. Suddenly one of the waiters spotted us and, in a rather brisk and arrogant manner with lots of arm movement, asked us to step back out of the room where the reception desk was located....when we had already been invited to step in by the  main room attendant!!!!!....sorry I was not impressed !!!.The breakfast room is absolutely amazing and the breakfast is wonderful with extremely good British and French produce mainly Possibly lacking of  a more wide selection of cheeses and cold meats.The waiters looked many times rushed. When they were reaching the main kitchen door  there was a bit of shouting amongst them when, I presume, they thought they couldn't be heard by the hotel residents.Whilst having breakfast during the last day there was a very world known italian football celebrity also having breakfast. In several areas of the Ritz trainers are banned including the breakfast room.  I was amazed when another customer who was also wearing trainers but obviously not a celeb, was asked  to return to his room and come back with shoes on....which he did whilst the italian soccer star was still in the same room !!!!We had one night dinner in the restaurant. It was absolutely fab and  certainly much better that the dinner we had at Claridge's the night before. When I made this comment to our waiter he reminded me that Claridge's belongs to the same hotel/restaurant chain. To this I replied that Gordon Ramsay's cook was certainly not as good as the one at the Ritz which gave him a smile.The Ritz's bar is an experience on its own and it was possibly my favourite place in the hotel. The waiters here were absolutely amazing. Their knowledge of how to serve cocktails, manners and general attitude towards clients were splendid. At the same time they looked very relaxed and they were very friendly. They also handled very well difficult situations with some very drunk, very rude customers who should not had been at The Ritz in the first place. Thank you.Reception, concierge, maids, doormen and the rest of staff were wonderful, attentive and helpful. We had a little delay getting our luggage brought to the main entrance but our doormen handled this extremely well with his comments and anecdotes.So as a whole I will give an overall ""excellent"" to the Ritz hotel in London. I would only suggest that, although our experiences during breakfast,t may be just a one of, my impression is that this needs looking into. Meanwhile we would like to thank the rest of the staff for making our long weekend in London a very happy time!Charles Avery", November 2012, Travelled with family

Just wanted to say a big thank you to all the staff who truly make the ritz experience so special. The hotels attention to detail and focus on really getting to know their guests makes it a very different holiday experience.  I couldn't fault anything at all about the place, service, food, ambiance....and the cocktails are to die for! Seriously nothing was to much trouble for the staff, anything you wanted they would sort for you.

Lucinda00,37,41,"Lovely hotel, but too commercial",[4.0],"We stayed at the Ritz for one night only, but the brevity of our stay provided me with a snapshot of a hotel into which I have not stepped foot for a decade.  Lots of high points.  Great location in St James.  Excellent service at all levels.  Tight security, perhaps a bit too obvious, with the earpieces all over.  Small lobby, quick registration.  Plush carpets, rooms are beautiful with any amenity you could possibly want.  No signs of wear anywhere.  Expensive furnishings.  We picked the least expensive room available, as we would be occupying it for less than 12 hours, but it was still extremely comfortable with a pretty view.  Great bar, good late night snacks.  Now the downside:  everywhere you turn there is a sales pitch.  The reception desk offered us a pricy membership in the hotel group's loyalty program...it costs money?  There are display cases in the hallways hawking various wares. Awaiting us in our room was a live tv channel displaying jewels...only jewels.  Tent cards on the bedside table, promoting Ritz gifts.  It was really too much.  If they just tone the marketing down a bit, it would be a better experience overall.  If the commercial pitch does not bother you, the Ritz is a good choice.", November 2012, Travelled as a couple

When we entered the room, there were two hearts of rose pedals outlined on the bed in recognition of our anniversary.  We joined friends in the bar for drinks and music.  The ambiance was engulfing in luxury and style.I will definitely be back!  Thank you for such a great experience.", October 2012, Travelled as a couple

My husband arranged a number of events prior to our arrival, everything was managed impeccably by the concierge Andy. And upon our arrival we received excellent recommendations and service throughout our stay from each and every person that we had the pleasure of encountering.

sfinestone,538,130,Exceeds all Expectations,[5.0],"Driving into London from the countryside in a rental car on a Friday afternoon proved more hectic than expected.  As we pulled up to the entrance of The Ritz, we received a warm and friendly greeting from Michael the Doorman.  He invited us to leave everything with him and to go into the hotel and relax after our journey.  We knew this was a great start to our three night stay.Once inside, Michael the Concierge (the other Michael) worked his magic and arranged for the rental car company to come pickup the car so that we would not have to drive any more in London traffic.  He even convinced the rental car firm to waive any fees.  We were then shown to our lovely room which was located on the third floor.  From the third floor one gets the full spectrum of the view into the reception lobby.Anyone planning to stay at The Ritz London should make sure to have breakfast included in their room rate.  Breakfast is served in the main dining room, which has long been hearlded as the most beautiful dining room in Europe.  I take no issue with that statement.  The servers dress in formal attire, but as with the entire Ritz staff, are friendly and polite.  At breakfast, our server remembered which fruit juice we each drank and how we liked our toast prepared. We found formality (which a hotel like the Ritz deserves) without stuffiness. I am not sure where they hide, but the cleaning staff managed to keep the bedroom amazingly clean, with towels replenished, toiletries refreshed and bed linens turned down in the evening.  All this is done without troubling the guest.  I stayed at The Ritz a couple of times in the 1980's, when many Americans thought it was part of the Ritz-Carlton hotel group.  This is not the case with this 100 year hotel that was lovingly built by Caesar Ritz.  Every inch of this hotel is special, and the staff make it even better.I think my wife cried as we left, and Michael the Doorman appeared sorry to see us leave and anxious for us to return.  We do not want to disappoint Michael, a true ambassador for what may be the finest hotel in the world.  I recommend the Ritz London to any traveler who can appreciate a place that is truly unique and magnificent, operated by a team that realizes what they have and what they need to do to preserve their traditions.", November 2012, Travelled as a couple

We’ve just come back from a 3 night stay at the Ritz for my Wife’s 40th Birthday and we enjoyed the whole experience immensely. From being greeted from our Black Cab, bags taken, shown through to reception and introduced as ‘Team Williamson’ (my Wife, 2 young daughters and I) the stay just got better and better. I’m afraid I’m terrible with names but the Gentlemen on Reception were really courteous & helpful and promptly gave my Daughters a Ritz Teddy each and membership to the ‘Kidz at the Ritz’ club (which included complimentary milkshakes at the Rivoli Bar). Due to a cancellation we were fortunate enough to get a room upgrade from a Junior Suite to a Deluxe Two Bedroom Suite for a real knock down rate (more than I had budgeted for but worth every single penny!). Tea at the Ritz was exceptional and all the staff were extremely polite and helpful (the Happy Birthday recital from the Pianist bringing a tear to the eyes of the Ladies who were celebrating their special day). Speaking of the Pianist, my 8 year old asked him if he could play some Disney tunes which he promptly did with some aplomb…..fantastic! I could go on and on about the attention we received - Happy Birthday card and cake in our room on arrival, complimentary Ritz and Arlington Bear jigsaw for the children, guided tour on arrival at the hotel by a Gentlemen from Reception, access to the hospitality suite for complimentary Tea, Coffee and Fudge on arrival while are upgraded room was being made up etc., etc.. With regards to the negative comments on this site regarding dress code and expense, do yourself a favour and have a good look on the Ritz website! It’s all there, nothing is hidden in terms of the expected dress code and all the prices for drinks, meals etc. are clearly shown.

I mean, it's a fabulous hotel in a great part of London. I'm so glad your staff wants to ensure that the guests are well looked after. It shocks me that anyone finds security suspicious or intimidating. There isn't a five star hotel anywhere that doesn't ask to see your room key or have hotel security/detectives making certain only guests go where only guests belong. Some hotels you need to use your room key card to access the elevator. Also... If you leave your key with the House Porter, it's great! The staff knows you're out and your bound to have our room serviced and that magical treat or chilled champagne will be waiting when you return.The rooms are old world but not old fashioned. They are Paris Ritz French-style, fin de siecle decor. Not to everyone's taste. But: The hotel has very large rooms, and everything is in perfect condition. It's  such a gracious place. It's no more forbidding or grand than any other five star luxury hotel. but people seem to have higher expectations here than at all the other London hotels.

The breakfast buffet was unbelievable, the pastries, even the yogurt was mouthwatering!  The location was ideal, close to almost everything in the city.  The hotel is located right next to the Green Park stop on the Blue Piccadilly line, making the entire city, even Heathrow airport accessible.  We did not have a reservation for have ""afternoon tea"" at the Ritz.  if you plan on partaking in this tradition, you need to make reservations up to 6 months beforehand.

Joshua027,3,4,Good hotel but very pricey,[4.0],"Stayed here for four nights with my wife and friends on a recent trip to Europe. Despite the large number of hotels to stay at in London we chose the Ritz for two reasons. First it is part of the AMEX (American Express) Fine Hotels program and second because of the reputation surrounding this hotel. It was a nice stay and I am glad we saw and stayed there once, but I probably wont be a repeat visitor. Let me explain. The hotel is pricey (it cost a bit less than the Four Seasons Hotel in Geneva- but was not nearly as memorable an experience). I felt upon check out that I was nickle and dimed for EVERYTHING. For example, having booked through AMEX, I received breakfast for two each day of our stay. This is for the continental breakfast. All members of our group decided on the buffet, which was 3 dollar more each. Most hotels just waive the charge (after all this is 3 dollars on a 620 per night room). Not the Ritz. It was charged everyday. Another example is when we decided to go to the theatre. The concierge did a great job of securing us tickets but failed to mention the 10% service charge they added to the cost (we still would have gone but it would have been nice to know ahead of time). And lastly this hotel is somewhat stuck up. Unlike other hotels we stayed at during this trip (Four Seasons Geneva, Fairmont Palace in Montreux) this hotel has dress codes and has a noticeable air of snobbery. Dont get me wrong. We had a good stay, it is just that I will try out other hotels on my next trip to London", September 2012, Travelled as a couple

The TV in the room was really poor; it was too small for the room and half the channels didn't work. My main criticism though is with the prices. The mini-bar must have been designed for the blind or the insane (one of the cheapest items is a pack of M&Ms for £10). We made the mistake of ordering room service late one night; just a couple of sandwiches and a pot of tea - £63. I wouldn't care but they were really small sandwiches. Needless to say, we didn't pay £84 for the hotel breakfast.Drinks in the bar are expensive but I have to say that I had one of the best Bloody Marys ever in the Rivoli Bar.A coach trip of south east asian tourists were checking in - maybe that's who this hotel is catering for.

The real drawback of our stay was the street noise that was ever-present in our room four stories above the pavement.

Either the hotel has undergone a subtle update, or I am now at an age where I appreciate its appeal!  Its charm is the period feel and it has certainly not felt the need to update itself - but it is not shabby.  Breakfast was the only disappointment - I felt the buffet was poor and significantly overpriced for the lack of variety on offer.  I'm sure it used to be quite impressive.

Last February I had booked a short stay as our main travel plans were in continental Europe. Our plans changed suddenly and we ended up staying nine glorious days at the Ritz. The concierge (hall porter) staff is simply the best in the business. Ask them for a restaurant recommendation and you will not be disappointed. Ask them for theater or Opera tickets and you'll get the best seats in the house. Ask them for a chauffeured car to Blenheim and you'll get not only a driver, but an expert of British palaces.The room service is truly outstanding. I kept wondering how they could cook and deliver with such speed. The overall friendliness of the staff is unique.Yes, they have a dress code, but that is part of the charm of this hotel. While they have included the best of the modern world, including lighting fast wifi, the place looks and feels as if Cesar Ritz were alive and the Edwardian era never ended. Other great London hotels, like Claridges, have lost their charm precisely because they are full of blue jean clad sandal-wearing tourists.I would send managers of other five star hotels for a few nights stay at the Ritz so they learn how things should really be run.", February 2012, Travelled on business

From the moment we stepped out of the taxi and arrived the doormen were friendly, polite and turned out to be a wealth of knowledge and advice.  The reception staff greeted us and were very friendly and one of them showed us around where the restaurant and bar and lounges were located. In the meantime our luggage was taken to our room. The room was fabulous, not only spotlessly clean but every single thing was taken into consideration. even a small celebration cake was left for me and a greeting card for my birthday. Must mention the bedlinen and pillows because that is a particular ""thing"" with me. The bed linen is fine linen and the pillows quite conceivably the most comfortable I have ever slept on. The bathroom and towels also  superb.. We had breakfast each morning we stayed and tried a variety of choices, I could not possibly fault anything we had. The waiters were polite, friendly but inobstrusive. We also dined in the restaurant in the evening and as expected the choice and quality of the food and wines were truly exceptional. We actually went to the theatre two of the nights we stayed at the hotel but went to the Rivoli Bar afterwards. Should anyone be fortunate enough to go to the Ritz then please do not miss this. The bar staff are so knowledgeable about drinks, we asked their advice and were not disappointed. I felt I had gone back in time with the decor, it is so splendid. So, staying at this hotel is such a wonderful experience, not a once in a lifetime because we will most definitely go back again, we have in fact stayed at some lovely hotels in the past but the Ritz reigns supreme, and certainly for my birthday, will always be memorable for the right reasons. I must also add this, someone asked me, quote, ""did you spend a lot of money giving tips, that is what would put me off staying somewhere like this"".  I really do have to say that not at any time did any member of staff give any indication they expected tipping, we were also treated exactly with the same deference, I am certain of this, that any visiting celeb would be. Any lingering anxieties we would be ""out of place"" at the Ritz were instantly dispelled.  Hope that helps anyone who may read this.", October 2012, Travelled as a couple
cucuruchito,357,197,A timeless beautiful place in the heart of London,[5.0],"The Ritz London is wonderful. As soon as you get there the feeling is you re travelling in time.. I think this sensation is a plus you get only in a few unique places… so it should be considered when you face the rates...,i think it was worth it.  The atmosphere is elegant, sophisticated, timeless… the warmth of the hallporters,  and the  doormen- that would soon call you by your name- make you feel that you re just coming back to your own london home,even if you ve never been there . Afternoon tea at the Ritz is quite an experience and it should not be missed. Fortunately, the hotel manages to have certain availabilty of some tables for its guests should they  want to make a sudden reservation for tea , even though I would recommend booking in advance as these tables might anyway become unavailable. It s been lovely to have afternoon tea in such lovely lounge with my 9 year old son, all dressed in a suit… who was delighted with the most delicious scons ever, the classic sandwiches, and everything else…with the exception of the orange juice…  (The only thing that didn t match …is the orange juice…  Kids usually have juiceinstaed of tea or coffee.. and the juice they bring to the afternoon tea - and also at breakfast-  is not freshly squeezed as one should expect in such a venue , it is more like ofthe juice box type… and tasted awfull.. it definetely  does not match with the impeccable tea ritual at the Ritz…. ) So, afternoon tea was lovely, I would definetely recommend it. Packing nice clothes is part of the whole Ritz London experience, men are not  allowed at the restaurant wearing  jeans and sneakers, or t shirts.. (they have a changing room in case someone in a group might needto borrow some trousers)-  At his hotel following the dress code is a must and is part of the game… everything matches with the elegance and charm of the place.Our suite was beautifully decorated and  very comfortable,  overlooking Picadilly and St James Park.. I would not change anything… ( … or yes..maybe I would…the telephones! They are too common, they do not match.. a bit outdated (not nice vintage), and they don t have the labels so you can quicky dial…  I always had to call the operator first if I wanted room service or to talk to the concierge… ). As for the rest, the room was perfect.The concierge service! It  is one of the best ones in the world! Andy, Michael and Tony were always there helping us with anything we might need, they manage tofind for us excellenIt theatre tickets for Shrek, The Musical,  on the same day (many times during the same week! ) They are kind and professional in all aspects and are the ones that do make a difference for a perfect stay. I d like to thank them all!Even, the same day we were flying to New York, we forgot our passports in our suite safe box, and I realized about this at the airport check in counter! In total distress, I called the hotel and told Andy about the problem , and he immediately took care of everything, he sent a hotel car with the passports, so they arrived at the airport in the following 40 minutes. Thank you  so much, Andy!    Housekeeping service and Room Service  were also perfect and they surprise you  with complimentary unexpected  fruit, or pastries from the hotel kitchen.We had only a mixed emotions moment : The hotel usually offers the fourth night in a deluxe suite on compliment. This offer was available at the time of our stay but unfortunately we could not benefit from it as I  First  booked for a short stay of three nights with my little son. The same day I  checked out  after those three nights, we had to go back to the hotel , due to some problems with our flight that evening , and asked to stay for an extra night so we could think about how to reschedule our flight. (We were  given a new deluxe suite, 518,  similar to the previous one) The following morning, with my husband we decided to stay more time in London and extended our stay in the same Ritz deluxe suite for three more nights…the suite was available so I thought this time we deserved the fourth night on compliment which was an  offer still  available at the time of our booking. We were told at the front desk that in order to have that benefit  we  were supposed to book the four nights at the exact same moment.  We couldn t have done that as we needed a lilttle time to think.  I asked the front desk to explain the situation to the duty manager , but the front desk called us back to our suite to tell us that in spite we would stay in the same suite for four nights, we could not have our fourth night on compliment,  because the system accepts it only when the four nights are booked at the same exact moment. Of course I said I understood, but it was quite a disappointment … and not because of the money- I ve been lucky enough to stay at many of the best hotels in the world, and I know that it is in someone s power to understand and make a better, wiser decision- and that did not happen. In such a hotel I would n t expect ¨the system¨ to be the ultimate decision maker. We stayed 7 consecutive nights (from Sept 29 th till Oct 2 nd (three nights) under my name and from Oct 2 till Oct 6 th (4 nights more) under my husband s name) in a deluxe suite   … In such a hotel I would n t expect ¨the system¨ to be the ultimate decision maker.…   In spite of that moment, I still do recommend staying at the Ritz London, I loved the charm of the hotel, and would like to be back to soon. The location is perfect, walking distance to Buckingham Palace and St James Park…  near all public transport - if you love riding the double deckers as we do, number 14 th leaves you directly in front of Harrods (don t miss this lovely store and having lunch at the food court there! ), Bus 14 also takes you to the Natural History Museum… the 38 or 19 takes you to the British Museum. Covent Garden is also near with great theatre and bars.  The underground station is also right there! .Taxis are a great option as well. Not expensive and so british...Taking taxis is a pleasure in London,  taxi drivers are real gentlemen, completely the opposite of new york taxis drivers!!!!  Enjoy a conversation with them, they know everything and would always be glad to answer questions or describing places.  I also recommend The Wolesley ,  a lovely restaurant just across Arlington Street… it used to be a car store in the past, and a bank ! , the building is amazing and it is also very well preserved.. the food is delicious...another trip in time!  London is a unique place… and a stay at the London Ritz enhances the whole british experience ! As Gene Wilder and Danny Boyle say in Young Frankenstein: Put on the Ritz ! .", September 2012, Travelled with family
Misa,44,21,Our new home in london,[5.0],"My husband and I stayed at The Ritz for 4 days to celebrate my 50th birthday.  It was everything we could have hoped for.  Beautiful accommodation, warm and welcoming staff, fabulous atmosphere, central location, great food and champagne. Nothing was too much trouble and our stay was the highlight of our 5 week trip away.  The little touches were lovely, the tea tray in our room after a busy day sightseeing, storing our kids luggage while we had tea with them, squeezing us in for an impromptu drinks and dinner.  Stayed at another 5 star hotel later in our trip and there was no comparison. Just looking at when we can visit again.", March 2012, Travelled as a couple
FLYINGBLUEDOG,299,126,Wow Wow Wow,[5.0],"The complete experience! Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary we decided to visit London as tourists (although we are only a 40min train ride away), and what better place to choose than The Ritz!Dinner was an event, so much so we opted for a last night 'dinner-in' rather than going out, our original intention. But after a hard days touristing it seemed a lazy, but well deserved option.The Louis Seize interiors take a bit of getting used to as it really is over the top gilt, but we could suffer that!The cocktail bar is a delight with it's thirties Deco interior and Lalique wall lights.It was a treat to be greeted by the doorman on return with 'Welcome back'.However, not all was well......our first room, a junior suite as booked, reeked of it's previous occupants -smokers!! My wife rang reception and asked for a new room and failing that a return car to our home at their expense. A massive fire fighting exercise kicked in led by their apologetic young manager which included free cocktails, valet transfer of our bags and belongings to a top floor Green Park suite for one night and then a valet transfer while we were out the next day to a non-smoking junior suite overlooking Piccadilly. According to my wife at no time during the booking process were we offered the choice of smoking or non-smoking and assumed, wrongly, that all hotel rooms in the UK were non-smoking. It did, initially, literally leave a bad taste in the mouth though....Breakfast....why oh why is the toast served before the main course and allowed to go cold??? Remedied by a specific request and remembered by our waiter the following day. However the thin bread used for the toast was poor and next to processed/plastic bread. I like my toast thicker with a crusty outside and soft inside (for next time please note!!) At dinner the brioche was excellent and despite putting a request in for some for breakfast to the maitre d, unfortunately this did not get through to the breakfast chef.......Scrambled egg for my wife was poor, but soon remedied into something special.....Afternoon tea......well, what can I say...as many sandwiches as we could manage, plenty of cakes and scones....yummy! Lovely way to end our break!!", September 2012, Travelled as a couple

Six of us went for afternoon tea to celebrate my Mom's 80th birthday and my friend's 50th birthday. We were a mised age group consisting of my two daughters (in there 20's) myself and my friend and Mom and Aunty (in there 80's) and we all enjoyed afternoon tea.

There are not enough superlatives in the english language to describe our weekend.  From the moment the doorman helped us from the taxi we were transported to another world - a glamourous world we normally only see in films.  The interior of the hotel is luxury personified.  All the staff were absolutely wonderful and attentive and whilst they must see thousands of guests a year, to remember and address us by our names throughtout the stay made us feel like royalty.  Our bedroom and bathroom were stunning with surperb views along Piccadilly.  The food for both breakfast and dinner was of the highest order with a good choice of menu and attention to every detail.  Saturday night dinner with music and dancing will long live in our memories and I can't imagine anywhere where there might be a more beautiful restaurant.

AYellowWood,26,22,A mixed bag,[4.0],"I was very excited about staying at The Ritz and overall I enjoyed it ... but I won't be returning any time soon. It started moments after arrival, when I had to tell the woman at reception three times that yes, my partner and I were staying in the same room. Twice, she looked at me and said, ""But there is only one bed."" Twice, I stared at her stonily and said, ""Fine."" It started the long weekend on a sour note and made us feel conspicuous and uncomfortable, to say the least. We booked our room through AmEx platinum travel services, and booked a lower-middle tier room. The agent told us that the hotel did not seem to be very booked at the time of our visit, so we were likely to receive an upgrade (standard with AmEx platinum). it turned out that we did not receive an upgrade, and the room was on the smaller side. It was sumptiously appointed with beautiful drapes and bedcoverings, fireplace, etc ... but it was snug. This was my own fault, though, and I haven't made that mistake again. And while we thought breakfast was lovely and the service sublime .... the whole vibe felt a little too old and a little too serious -- terribly civilized and correct, but at the expense of making guests feel welcome.", November 2011, Travelled as a couple

Ok, we were staying the night too, but from the moment you walk in, you're treated like a celebrity - nothing is too much trouble.  The tea itself is fabulous - a choice of tea to your own taste so we could both have our own favourites, and bottomless pots too.  Beautifully presented and cut selection of sandwiches, with replenishment.  Then warm scones, with jam and clotted cream, followed by cakes.  It might look like there's not an awful amount to eat, but don't be fooled!  They come round with ""extras"" too, we had a delicious lemon posset, and then a cake trolley with lemon drizzle cake or Victoria sandwich too.  It's really not a tea but a feast!  We had to go for a walk afterwards, which was another experience - visit Fortnum and Mason's food court if you can, it's amazing!Staying at the Ritz is also wonderful, it's in a great location of course, the rooms are sumptuous and wonderful, the beds soft and huge, the en suite bathroom luxurious.  The lifts have to be seen to be believed - with paintings of elegant ladies of a bygone period adorning the walls!  Of course, breakfast can be served in your room and to your choice.

All for the price tag of £40 each, if you want champagne or a birthday cake then it will cost more.

edithTheHagueHolland,74,65,A great experience but not for disabled people.,[4.0],"We stayed in the Ritz six nights in August 2012 and had been looking forward to this trip. At arrival it was immediately clear that the hotel is not very welcoming for people in a wheelchair. There were stairs at the entrance and I had to go in through the backdoor, accompanied by security (and I have to mention that these men were very kind and friendly). After my husband checked in we ran into the next problem: the elevators were hardly big enough for my wheelchair but after trying and trying again we managed to reach our room at the third floor. Room was rather small and overcrowded with furniture but the bathroom was very big on the other hand. The Ritz is the most beautiful hotel I have ever seen, staff is very kind and helpfull but when you are in a wheelchair there are, apart from the main entrance, several places inaccessable. I could not enter the Palm Court, nor the Tivoli Bar or the Casinoclub and the Cigarhouse. The gardens do not exist anymore other than the garden for the private dining restaurant, the other part is taken by a semipermanent building from the Cigarhouse.As temperature was very high during our stay we were very happy with the excellent airco in our room but did regret the fact that there was no place to sit and relax outside with a book.We had dinner in the restaurant and loved the ambiance, service was great but the high standard off the kitchen they promise was disappointing. My fish was dry and cold, the foie gras not more than average quality. When we checked out I mentioned to the assistent manager that we we had not enjoyed our stay as much as we had thought we would there were excuses about the size of our room and all the inaccessabilities and a promise that next time.................

Nicola P,1,12,What type of mattresses do you use?,[5.0],"My partner and I stayed in one of the deluxe suites (room 421 I think!) on the evening of the London 2012 Closing Ceremony for the Olympics and the hotel is just fabulous. We had a fantastic stay and now really want to know where we can find the exact same mattress we slept on that night for our own home! It was just so comfortable! We have travelled all over the world but we both have to say, that particular mattress ,along with the super soft pillows, was just amazing. We have been having problems with our own mattress at home so are now on a mission to get room 421's mattress equivalent for our home. I would hugely appreciate if anyone knows what type of mattress it is?As for the service, food, drinks, staff... Everything was just fabulous and so enjoyable! Thank you very much for such a pleasant stay and we will be back, if not just to sleep in that bed again!!", August 2012, Travelled as a couple
fublife,262,824,You have to pay for quality,[5.0],"London obviously does not have the charm and history of Rome, but The Ritz is way up there with its very own way of presenting some of the finest that London has to offer. The employees of the hotel are extremely service-minded, and they only have one wish, and that is to ensure the well-being of their guests. The doormen and concierge of the hotel are world-famed for their service, and if you have not booked a table at one of the many Michelin restaurants in London, they will get you a table anyway, even through the wait can normally be up to six months.The hotel is one of the safest hotels in the world, so if you are a bit nervous about the unrest that is sweeping through the world, you can relax here.We stayed in one of the many lovely suites, with a view of Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly and Green Park, so the view as well as the suite lived up to our demands to the fullest. When in England, the minibar is obviously filled with a very large selection of beer, considering that it is a minibar. A giant bathroom with a bathtub large enough for my 188 cm always results in a big plus in the grade book.It is definitely not inexpensive to stay at The Ritz, but as I have said in so many other reviews, you have to pay for quality, and as long as you get what you pay for, this is not a problem, and at The Ritz, you will definitely go home with a positive experience, even though there is EUR 1,500 less in your wallet after just one overnight stay with dinner.", September 2011, Travelled as a couple
CoventryDeb,160,33,Wonderful experience!!!!,[5.0],"For our 25th wedding anniversary we booked a night at the Ritz, what a wonderful experience.  We arrived before our room was ready, so we were shown to a room where you can wait in luxury.  We were booked in for afternoon tea at 1.30 in the beautiful and opulent Palm Court.  The waiters were very attentive, bringing you more sandwiches and cakes if required.  The experience lasts for about 1hr & 45mins. The staff knew we were celebrating our anniversary and when we returned from an evening out our room had been decorated with rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed with a red rose in the middle. On the pillows there were more roses, and on the floor either side of the bed a white mat had been laid down with his & hers slippers & more rose petals. It was an absolutely wonderful surprise.

TheTravellingPeople,10,17,Simply the best hotel in the world !!! Afternoon tea is a must!,[5.0],"This hotel is known worldwide for its class and hospitality and as someone who is born and bred in London I decided that instead of going on a city break abroad me and my boyfriend will just spend two full days in London as we dont often go sightseeing so we chose to stay at the Ritz.We had an overstay at the Ritz for the first time - why did I leave it so long?We spend a full two days in London with an overnight stay in the Ritz where we had our breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and dinner. We wanted to make a day and night of it all in the one establishment and we were so glad we did..Breakfast has a big choice and the food is good quality. I had my usual eggs benedict but this tasted far better and I think thats down to the quality of the produce.Afternoon tea is amazing. They have an amazing brand of tea, I do not know what tea I just know this is a quality tea and I will now make it my mission to track it down - the Ritz should sell it - if it is not there tea just rebrand it and sell it - you have your first customer!!!The selection of cakes are varied and they were delightful and packed full of flavour. The finger sandwiches were incredible there were around 5 different varities and the fillings were delicious and the bread fresh as if it had come straight from the oven.Now the scones they are another level. I love a cream tea but its usually not served at my house but a country hotel somewhere so it is always a special occasion BUT an afternoon tea at the Ritz is something else- the scones these were special - served warm with clotted cream and jam and melted in your mouth. The also came around with 2 other cakes and topped up the tea, sandwiches and scnes constantly - with no extra charge.  On the third time of offering to top up the scones we said no - I wanted to say yes but I didnt want to seem greedy. Theyare worth a few rounds I probably wouldve skipped dinner for more of those..The waiters were so nice and friendly and they wouldnt even let us pour the tea. You cannot help but admire the training that gone into the service on offer. I think I will make afternoon tea at the Ritz a monthly occurance. Afternoon tea is an experience that should be on the list of 100 things to do before you die!!! When we had dinner and breakfast at the Ritz too I cannot fault a single thing. The service is outstanding the staff are not just polite and smart they offer suggestions which I like - I couldnt decide on a cocktail and the waiter asisted me in selecting drinks which is nice as I couldnt decide for the choice. The cocktails are stylish and have intense flavour. They are reasonable in price in price. I am not a drinker and rarely drink alcohol as I dont enjoy it but I could be an alcoholic if this was my local bar - I wish it was!!! The bar has amazing art decor with lovely service - our waiter was a lovely man - he had fair blond hair he was just lovely. He reccomended two chamapgne cocktails, one being the duchess of Cambridge or something along those lines and it had hibicus in it..that was a taste sensation!...I had two drinks and wanted more but realised two potent champagne cocktails on an empty stomach before dinner was not be a good idea - I cannot imagine the Ritz deal with drunks - lol!The service at the  Rivoli bar is amazing as is the service at Afternoon and dinner. Throughout the hotel from check-in to the lovely bell boys its a five star experience - the Ritz deserve there recongnition as one of the best in the world because I travel so much across the world and 5 star is the choice when I am with my boyfriend so I know high standards but this is high standards with personality. The decor is akin to staying within a palace. The staff wait on you hand and foot and are so kind and most of all they actually look happy. There is no pretenious atmosphere like in some expensive establishments. The people that dine here are all happy and having a great time I spent a full day here and saw noone complaining just happy people.You must come and stay here even if only for a night - it is an experience you will remember for a lifetime. It is worth spurging for because its a good memory.You cannot help but admire the time and training that has gone into providing this service. The best service, atmosphere, tea, room and nights sleep Ive ever had - and youve cured my boyfriends insomnia! (for one night)We just want to thank the staff so much  - because its the hospitality that makes the hotel wonderful...but just what was that brand of tea?If you want to feel like Royalty then the Ritz is the place to go...see you very soon!!!", August 2012, Travelled as a couple

Karen_Kingswinford,841,228,DECADENCE TO DIE FOR,[5.0],"This was a surprise outing for Afternoon Tea at the Ritz Hotel, London in celebration of my mother's 80th birthday. I cannot fault one solitary thing about the whole experience. Everything was absolutely perfect, the staff, the food, the tea and the whole ambience of that gloriously decorated decadent dining room.Valet parking was perfect, and the charge (£15.00) for central London I felt was an absolute bargain. The cost of tea (£42.00) is very reasonable, considering the mountains of sandwiches and fabulously naughty cakes and scones that just keep coming and coming until you are fit to burst- and of course the wonderful surroundings. My mother was presented with a beautiful small iced birthday cake and that was presented in a lovely Ritz gift box- whilst the pianist played 'Happy birthday'.

theblackhand,178,95,Ritz bar - good for a laugh,[4.0],"If you fancy splashing out on a drink or two and want to do so in surroundings that make you smile, head for the Ritz.  I was meeting the family before dinner in Mayfair, a bit of a celebration, so we decided to meet up at the Ritz.  Good decision.  I arrived first (as usual).  The bar was full (or at least all tables for 4 were reserved) which was fair enough, Friday night and I hadn't reserved, so I was sat in the lobby lounge.  Preferable, really, as we had more space and the decor is full on Ritz, fin de siecle, tart's parlour style, which is what was wanted; you don't go to the Ritz for understated sophistication!  I ordered a beer (£9.50 IIRC) and was warned (charmingly) that there is a minimum spend of £15 a head (don't worry, it's not difficult to achieve).  It turned up, beautifully cold, with delicious olives and other snacks, and a copy of the Telegraph.  I'm sure that tells us something, but I don't know what; maybe that The Ritz's clientele is not what it was, or that I look like a petit bourgeois old codger.  Anyway, it was a kind thought.The rest of the family eventually showed up and we selected from the extensive cocktail list, all about £20.  All very tasty, although they all tasted rather similar, but that's champagne cocktails for you.  Probably the best was my daughter's non alcoholic one, a snip at £12.  The most intersting was mine, which was essentially a simple champagne cocktail with three porcelain spoons containg foams of (IIRC) lemon, pomegranate and Dubonnet; a nibble of foam, a sip of champers.  A bit girly, but, again, that's champagne cocktails.  Constant replenishment of the olives (we could have skipped dinner) was welcome.  No doubt there are better cocktail bars in London (I'm no expert), and there are certainly more sophisticated ones, but if you want an opulent drink in opulent surroundings, and a bit of a grin, this is the place.  It got the evening off to a cheery start.", August 2012, Travelled with family

I was slightly cross with myself for not booking a suite but, really, the room lived up to expectation. Everything else exceeded expectation. The public areas are my idea of heaven. The casino is quite exceptional, with very friendly and welcoming staff. I wish we had had an evening free to try the food in the casino's beautiful restaurant.

The dinner and dancing is a fantastic evening if you are looking to do something slightly different on a Saturday night, the service, food and entertainment was thoroughly enjoyable and is definitely for all age groups.

Graham H,102,65,Almost perfect,[4.0],"Had a two day Ritz stay to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday - Booked two rooms, one for me and my wife and a twin for my 2 children (18 & 16). The service as you would expect is second to none and all the staff were courteous and polite at all times. The attention to detail is also first class. The rooms are as other people have stated a little dated but then you sort of think would it lose all its character if it was brought up to date too much.My only disappointment was the severity of the cost of staying, and before anyone says what do you expect it is the Ritz hotel and not a B&B in Blackpool let me explain. We had agreed the room rate for bed & breakfast for one night and dinner bed & breakfast for the second night so we knew exactly the costs involved. We also had booked afternoon tea on the first day and we knew the costs associated with this. It is the extras that make you cringe and think ""ouch"" that hurts - minimum price for house wine was £50 a bottle, a coke for my 16 year old was £6 and it goes on and on. So suddenly my evening dinner had £120 added to it for the bar bill. And which hotel charges £26 a day to use wi-fi? You guessed it its the RitzAll in all having said all that the hotel is fabulous and you do get treated like kings and queens but unless you are extremely wealthy (which I am not) you can suddenly find yourself reeling from the unexpected associated costs at staying The small touches like having your bed turned down with slippers laid at the edge of the bed is fantastic but I think the Ritz just needs to haul it back in a little and take a reality check particularly when there are so many fabulous hotels in London to choose fromFantastic as a one off treat but be prepared to pay for it", August 2012, Travelled with family

Yes there is a dress code but this is no secret. I like the fact they have security, and I have never had a problem with them. What amazes me is how shortly after checking in the staff knows your name. The last time I stayed there with my son I was chatting with Michael telling him how my son was going on a teen tour through Europe that summer, he gave me his card told me to give it to my son, and to tell him if were to run into any problems to call him.

intrepidtraveller030,65,50,Could be spectacular but needs some TLC,[4.0],"I imagine the Ritz would've been fabulous 15 or 20 years ago. But now? It definitely needs some work. There's a grand yet faded feel about the rooms, and the room I stayed in was by no means pristine which you would expect from the Ritz. There were stains on the tired carpet and the room was poorly lit, plus my heater didn't work and when it did, made a serious racket all night!The room service was fine but not exceptional, the food was fine but not exceptional, and I think that sums up the Ritz really - you expect and hope it will be exceptional, but it isn't anymore. With some TLC, a thorough clean and an interiors update, it would be wonderful again.Also, the food in the minibar was close to being out-of-date and tasted like it'd been in there for years. The chocolate had melted and reformed several times over, as if someone had taken it out then reconsidered and put it back in. Needless to say you're looking at £4 for a small bar of chocolate, £6 for a mineral water and £27 for a miniature bottle of wine.It would be wonderful if a hotel of the Ritz's scale and reputation could provide some kind of private outdoor area for smokers, as lots of people who come here do smoke and have to stand outside in the street like a spare part. At the Ambassador's Club on Hyde Park Corner, there's a fabulous outdoor area for smokers and I'm surprised the Ritz can't provide something similar.Overall, it's still a special place, but someone needs to give the Ritz a makeover.

Having been here about 6 months earlier for a friend's birthday we enjoyed that occasion so much we had to return. Our booking was a little complicated due to 3 of the party having particular, specific dietary requirements. However, this was not an issue and I was not made to feel at all awkward. The attention to detail on the day was superb and everything ran smoothly. My daughter, being lactose intolerant , was especially well looked after. Her own special plate of cakes/fruit was imaginative and more than ample. (Is it appropriate to request  a take home box?) Although you are allocated a time this is more than ample and there is NO feeling of being rushed. (Several contacts of mine had spoken of a ""conveyor belt approach"" and it being ""rushed"".This was not the case and I have no idea why such an opinion had been formed). Staff were friendly but not effusive. it was all just wonderful. We will return. Thank you.", February 2012, Travelled with family
Take my word for it...,229,215,"Lovely, but not a 5 star hotel...",[4.0],"My husband and I stayed at the Ritz for 3 nights in July.  The hotel is well situated for getting to all the must see tourist destinations.  The positives:  location, opulent and grand decor, friendly staff, very good concierge, very comfortable bed and great linens.  The negatives: not much space for clothes, no makeup mirror (ask for one they will send it up),  housekeeping is average at best.  We had a plate of olives, champagne and other stuff in our room upon arrival courtesy of our travel agent.  After two days the uneaten olives and open champagne bottle had not been removed.  Even after asking for the items to be removed it took two days and a second request to get the rotting olives removed from the room.  The breakfast dining room is lovely, but the selection of items on the buffet is average (hard boiled eggs, breads, cereal, smoked salmon, meats, fruit and yogurt). For the Ritz you would expect a little more.  It looks like any breakfast buffet at a Hilton or Holiday Inn.  Toast came cold to the table on two mornings.  While they have a dozen waiters buzzing around the dining room, getting your coffee refilled or a dirtly plate removed does not happen quickly.  The policy of dressing appropriately to enter different areas is quite bizarre.  While my husband couldn't enter the bar area one night around 11 p.m. for dessert because he didn't have a suit jacket on (hewas wearing a black Prada bomber jacet) we saw plenty of rule breakers at breakfast in the fancy dining room (teens in badly ripped jeans and running shoes, etc.).  Having said all that, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel but I wouldn't return.   Also, the noise from the street was very loud at night (sirens, horns honking, etc.).  If you are staying ask for a room on a high floor or away from the main street.  We ate at a couple of great restaurants:  Hakkasan (Asian and close to the hotel) and Daphne's in Chelsea (about a 15 minute drive) and the food was outstanding. It's Italian and one of the best meals we had on the trip. Carlucci's for lunch was also really yummy.", July 2012, Travelled as a couple

Germaphobic1234,6,4,"Good enough, but not perfect.",[3.0],"For this hotel I had very high hopes. Booked a Junior Suite at 615 to 650 pounds a night, for 4 nights. As soon as I walked in the lobby I smelled a sickening damp sweet smell, which is probably coming from the wet trodden down carpet in the middle. Holding my breath, I checked in. The reception and porter are all very polite, friendly, and pleasant. Which took the edge off the smell. As we chatted on our way to room 314, the nice young man told me the hotel has been around 106 years old. Impressive history, but I've always feared the condition of the bathrooms and ventilation systems at these historic hotels. To my amazement the bathroom at 314 was exceptionally large, bright, and clean. Room 314 ""Junior Suite"" is not really a suite. It's just one spacious room because there is nothing separating the sitting room and bedroom. There isn't a guest bathroom either, not to mention a foyer, which makes it a room, not a suite. But I guess if I want a suite at the Ritz the meager 615£ / night will have to be at least tripled. Just because I looked Chinese, they gave me a Chinese newspaper, some almost expired Chinese cookies and rice biscuits. Which I did not find heartwarming at all. Just because I looked Chinese they printed my nationality on my info card as CHN, doesn't matter the fact that I gave them a Canadian passport. The room doesn't even have a Uk extension cord, only a mainland China wall socket. I think this room is especially reserved for mainland Chinese. They ought to know that there are many different kinds of Chinese from all over the world. I had to call them to bring me a standard UK extension cord. There is no plug in the bathroom for the dryer. Nor there is a socket in the room. The hair dryer in the bathroom drawer is covered in dust at its filter. The telephone has grime stuck in the edges.", July 2012,nan

patentattorney,69,59,It's the Ritz but is that enough?,[4.0],"Stayed for only one night which was a Christmas gift. I am from London but no longer live there so was excited to be staying there because the location cannot be faulted. The hotel is on the doorstep of bond street or jermyn street so luxury shopping if that's what you are after is easy. The staff were fabulous, friendly and not over attentive and there is a relaxed feel in the hotel which is great because sometimes it is difficult to achieve that in such grand opulent surroundings. The rivoli bar is fabulous. All lalique and leopardskin. You just feel special being there. The dining room is just so beautiful the hotel is not so big that you feel lost in it and I think that allows the staff to recognise you so you do feel very much at home.However I do have some criticisms of the hotel. Toiletries in the room were not up to scratch.Just naming them highgrove does not cut it for me. There was no bath size soap. Come on ritz owners this is a >£500.00 per night room. Toiletries were what you would get in a 3 star Hilton.  Furnishings were a little old fashioned in my room. but don't get me wrong my room was nice. My major criticism is for the food. We ate in the restaurant on a Sunday evening. There was only a table d'hôte menu. There was no bread only Melba toast. When was the last time anyone served Melba toast? The food however was superb. Breakfast was just as quirky as the Melba toast. Packet cereals in jars, special k, rice krispies. Rice krispies at the ritz? My kippers were not fresh. My husband said his full English was ok. The buffet selection was woefully inadequate if compared to other world renowned hotels in it's class. Even though we asked for toast we didn't get it. Clearly there was none left maybe as it had all been used for Melba toast?This hotel trades on it's name and the experience of staying at the ritz. I think the owners must make enough money with out having to try too hard. It certainly makes a fortune from afternoon tea it had only just ended when we went down to dinner.I am lucky enough to have stayed atsome of the best hotels in the world and in my opinion it's 4* in some areas. So if you are coming to London and need your "" Ritz experience"" come, it's the ritz. But if you travel and stay in this class of hotel regularly you may be disappointed.

Margaret B,1,12,"Historic hotel leaves us not amused, or impressed",[2.0],"My husband and I have stayed at 4- star boutique luxury hotels that are better than this 5-star hotel. We were staying at the Ritz the last few days of our honeymoon. While the room was comfortable and elegant, and overall the service was good from the porters and housemaids, we really felt like third-class citizens every time we came back to the hotel from touring the city in our comfortable clothes and shoes. The security person at the main door would ask questions such as ""Do you need directions?"" (very offensive... as if we were lost and wandering into the hotel for no good reason) or ""Are you staying at the hotel?""  One evening, when we were coming back from dinner and dressed in fancier outfits, we received no such questions but a polite hello. The question arises, 'If I was Johnny Depp walking through the door in his typical scruffy outfit, would I receive the same kind of questions?"" Most definitely not! My recommendation: bring expensive-looking walking shoes and VERY fashionable comfortable casual clothes for when you play tourist and decide to stay at the Ritz. P.S.

Frederic1,8,13,Judy's Review of the Ritz:,[5.0],"We’re on our way to catch the 7:15 AM flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles where we’ll catch a connecting flight to London.  Too early for Bloody Marys so we have tea and coffee at the only airport concession stand that’s open.  The Honolulu airport feels strangely weird in this nearly deserted condition.  We watch the sun come up in all its peach and apricot glory. I’m in shambles by the time I crawl off the plane.  The dry air and lack of solid sleep has added 10 years to my demeanor, I’m sure. But we’re soon greeted by the welcome sight of Roy, our driver. Dressed smartly, he helps us gather up our luggage and we proceed into London town to the Ritz.  It feels good to settle into the back seat of our car and be driven for the next five days without worries or cares.We are successfully registered and shown to our “deluxe” room and despite a somewhat peculiar layout a long hall containing two closets (one concealing the mini bar) and the entrance to the bathroom leads from our front door to our bedroom, it is indeed a luxurious suite of rooms.  With its floor-to-ceiling French doors opening onto Green Park, its full flowing, heavy floral tie-back draperies, its gold leaf moldings and marble mantled fireplace, it is exactly what I had envisioned. The Ritz Restaurant: I am in awe.  I had been unaware that this dining room is considered one of the most beautiful in all of Europe.  It is of such opulence that it takes my breath away.  The entire room is comprised of round tables set for two or four.  White tablecloths flowing to the floor contrast with red crushed velvet chairs.  Crystal and silverware gleam and multiply in the mirrored surfaces.  Overhead there are so many chandeliers that I later learn the ceiling had to be specially reinforced to hold their weight. We are seated in front of a gold leaf Neptune with various nymphs and maidens reclining in a sylvan glade painted on the wall behind him.  I reach for my napkin in order to arrange it on my lap and in so doing touch the tablecloth.  We are in serious linen country here.   I have never felt such rich, heavy, damask in my life.  Add to that the fact that it is overlaid on a second heavy linen round that falls to the floor.  This in an age when in most restaurants you’re lucky to get a place mat.  Next stop is the Rivoli Bar.  All male patrons must wear jacket and tie but we knew this so Freddy is prepared.  Not so some of the others that try to get in and are gently offered a box of carefully folded ties from which to choose and a house jacket.  It’s an interesting study to watch how different people play their roles in this little scene.  Some huff off; some smile and go off to fetch their own tie and jacket. The Rivoli Bar is a sensuous room, all done up in art deco, with gleaming surfaces of polished wood, mirrored walls, velvet covered chairs, Lalique glass, and gold leaf everywhere.  The seductively curved bar seats four and exudes an air of privilege and exclusivity.  I order a double bourbon with a splash of soda and Freddy has scotch.  Nicolas, the bartender, is straight out of a movie with his impeccably white dinner jacket and slicked back Leonardo Dicaprio hair.  He charmingly chats us up and we find out that he is German-Belgique.  During the conversation he suggests we inquire at the front desk about becoming members of The Ritz Club. We did. We repair to the The Ritz Club for cognac and Calvados.  The bar in The Ritz Club, warm and gracious, envelops us in quiet luxury.  We are Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in a 1930s film. Too soon, six days have passed and we must head home to Hawaii. It feels sad to leave.  Everyone has made us feel so welcome and the time has passed by so quickly, but we’re organized and ready to head back to Heathrow.  Freddy takes the elevator to the lobby but I linger a bit by wandering slowly down the central circular staircase, bidding the fairyland that is the Ritz, “Goodbye.”", September 2011, Travelled as a couple

I didn't really plan it out and flew in last-minute but the reception staff were incredibly professional, charismatic and composed - it is obvious they were trained well (or just incredibly used to eccentricity).The room was beautifully decorated, spacious and one of the rare hotels where the photos on the website realistically represent the rooms. There was an outlet for North American (or Swiss...I forget) plugs which was a life saver since I didn't even consider a UK adaptor. I was not a fan of the bed, the mattress seemed ancient and clearly saw and felt better days. The bathroom was perfect, I could have slept in there instead and be happy - but the scale was unnecessary, I don't want to think about my weight Ritz! Besides the mattress quality - I really could find no fault with the room.I stayed here alone - but it's the perfect hotel for couples, the ambiance and decor is incredibly romantic and charming.

Most of all it was quiet, something lacking in some of the other 4*/5* London hotels I've stayed in.Afternoon tea was an experience, in a positive way, but it is very expensive (as you would expect) for what is basically a never ending plate of cucumber sandwiches and scones and cups of tea.

We really wanted to return for our 10th anniversary though we were a little nervous at trying it again.  Let me say upfront, everything was perfect in every way.  First impressions; our bags were taken from the cab, Reception gave us a warm welcome and showed us to our room and Concierge welcomed us and offered their assistance should we need it.  Our room was a superior which was a perfect size for the 2 of us and immaculately clean.  The unsung heroes here are the housekeeping who kept the room perfect and provided the most impressive turn down service to come back to from dinner we have experienced.   We had tea in the afternoon and this too was wonderful with a warm greeting from the Maitre d' and excellent service throughout.  We dined in the Ritz Restaurant and our last experience of this was many years ago.  The quality of menu and food was outstanding and the service far more attentive than our visit of years gone by.

Our dinner in the dining room was absolutely outstanding. We had an issue with a cigar smoking guest in the adjacent room which resulted in the offer of upgrade which we declined.

skyvicky123,31,4,Most amazing hotel experience of our lives!,[5.0],"We stayed the day after our wedding as a mini honeymoon. It was the most special experience. Upon arrival we were greeted by the doorman who asked our names and took our bags. When we got to the reception desk they already knew who we were. So clever! We were so delighted to be told our room had been upgraded to a suite and that a complimentary bottle of champagne was waiting for us!The room itself was just outstandingly beautiful, with an enormous king size bed, ornate antique furniture and a comfortable sitting area. We had to take a few moments to take it all in.There were so many little details that were so cleverly done, the fragrancer who visited our room just before we arrived and again in the evening so everything smelt of flowers, the cocktails delivered when we returned to go to bed. The turndown service, the flowers on the bed...just endless. We can't compliment them enough. This is our first time staying at a hotel at this end of the market, however we can't help thinking that we would not experience this level of service anywhere else in the world.We had drinks in the Rivoli Bar followed by an outstanding meal in the Ritz Restaurant. Quite honestly the best food we have ever tasted. A revelation for us both. Just incredible, it left us both speechless.Words just cannot describe sufficiently what an experience the Ritz Hotel is. We are desperately racking our brains to work out when we can justify our next visit....One important point to mention. Please don't think you would feel uncomfortable in this environment. The staff, while polite and formal are also genuinely friendly and disarming. They do all you can to make you feel comfortable.

I was hesitant to stay here initially, intimidated by the ""fanciness"" of the hotel (we're ""jeans & tshirts"" people).  But upon arriving, everyone (the doorman, concierge, bellboys) was SO friendly and helpful.  They really do pride themselves on service.Our room was beautiful, spacious and clean.  They even included a Chinese newspaper (for my husband) among the magazines, as well as oolong tea.  We didn't request this, so I'm guessing they assumed from our last name? The view wasn't so great (another building) but we didn't mind since we were always running around the city.We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but we did have afternoon tea and it was a great experience! It was fun to dress up for one night and take in all the opulence.  There are a few cafes and a Starbucks across the street from the hotel if you're craving an early am caffeine fix.The location of the hotel was perfect.  There is a metro station just down the street so it's very convenient.    Overall, I would highly recommend this place.

On arrival, we had a free room upgrade and what a room it was; a marvellous chambre’ full of old world charm and modern amenities. As for the bathroom, it was bigger that some London hotel bedrooms (if you’ve ever stopped at Clubquarters in St Pauls, you will know exactly what I mean). The bed was sumptuous and the pillows were goose down and so comfortable that we bought a set of our own when we returned home.The Rivoli bar is opulent and sophisticated and had a fabulous range of drinks. We ordered champagne cocktails which had real gold leaf floating about in them. It was an extravagant touch and it really added to the experience.The Ritz restaurant was very impressive. The food was superb and surprisingly, it was very reasonably priced. We had fun people watching and to trying to guess who the other diners were and what they did. Oligarchs and royalty on the whole methinks On the Saturday night, we ordered a bottle of pre-dinner champagne to drink in our room but when we left for the restaurant, the maid cleared the bottle away.  I was a bit surprised as there was still a small amount of champagne left.  When we mentioned it to the concierge, he had a full bottle of pink Moet delivered to our room with the compliments of the hotel. At £350 a bottle, we thought that was a nice touch!!!!If you want a change from the run of the mill 5* hotels, then I’d definitely recommend trying ‘The Ritz’.

Dont worry, the hotel has high standards but they are gently enforced. We dressed in a smart but casual way on arrival and whilst using reception. Using the bar we dressed up a little more and this really makes you feel like you belong. Embracing the hotels elegance by dressing appropriatly makes the hotel more enjoyable.The level of service is difficult to capture in a review. It's about anticipation of your needs before you have even thought of them. It's about friendliness and helpful advice. Its about providing the highest level of service that can possibly be achieved.

afcone,34,21,Fantastic facilities undermined by snotty service,[2.0],"My girlfriend and I booked a night at the Ritz as a birthday treat as we had always wanted to stay in this world-famous hotel.  The building itself didn't disappoint with its elegant luxury.  The room was excellent - it was spacious and classically decorated.However, my stay was let down by the attitude of some (not all) of the staff I encountered.  I've been fortunate enough that in my job I've had the privilege of staying in a number of world-class hotels.  In all others the service has been welcoming, in line with the experience that such hotels aim to offer.  In the Ritz, it was sometimes stand-offish and in certain cases downright rude.  For example: Returning to the hotel after a night out I was virtually rugby tackled by a night doorman who demanded to know where I was going. Before I had a change to reply, I got the third reminder *that day* that 'one must wear a tie in the bar' - except that I wasn't going to the bar, I was returning to my room.  When I stated this, he just turned around and walked away without saying another word.  This gave a dreadfully poor impression, that my girlfriend and I were somehow unsuitable for their hotel.  I repeat, I have never had other world-class hotels make this impression, so I do not think this is the result of having some sort of chip on my shoulder.My view: if you're going to spend £300+ on a one-night hotel stay, avoid the Ritz and go somewhere else where you'll be made to feel welcome, rather than being treated like pond scum.", August 2011, Travelled as a couple

She said if you want the full experience go to the Ritz! We hopped in a taxi, walked up to this grand desk and asked if it was possible to have tea. The lady was very polite and said you must book tea in advance but it is possible to be served tea in the bar. Then she asked if either of us were wearing athletic shoes. We both giggled because my daughter in law had just purchased a pair of black flats right before we walked in. She had changed out of her ""athletic shoes"" because she did feel ""frumpy"" that day. London women seem to always be dressed in the latest fashion but we were sight seeing that day and walking over 5 miles. We did have a wonderful tea and cocktail to match in the bar. The waiter could not have been kinder explaining everything to us. The place setting was very beautiful; silver tea pot and all. The nibbles that came free were also quite lovely.

How do they do it?Tables were found at booked out restaurants and tips and hints for transport, shopping and sightseeing were spot on.

I booked a decent room and asked to be upgraded which was made available to me which was a very deluxe suite. The receptionist was very polite calling me by my last name Mr Anderson and was take up to our suite via the gallery by Joseph who was very informative and also mentioned our afternoon tea booking at 5.30.During our walk to our room we were passed by several Ritz members of staff who all welcomed us to the Ritz. Our baggage soon arrived after. Very swift and spot on.Afternoon tea was amazing and fulfilling, the only concern I had was the amount of eastern Europeans working and rushing around, considering the Ritz hotel is a benchmark for what it is to be English and how the English way is done but none the less it was up to scratch, we even asked to have our left over cakes taken to our room which they were more than happy to including offering a fresh slice of cake which was swiftly taken to our room.Breakfast was at a very good standard but once again not understanding some things said by eastern European waiter, including having to ask him to repeat things he was asking, toast being a hard one, but I gave him my most sincerest apology for this.Overall The Ritz still has some of its Britishness, top service and class but lacks that specialness which my father mentioned to me he found all them years ago.

geoffrey d,49,31,Not so ritzy !,[4.0],"On the 11th. day of the 11th. month, 2011, I chose to meet my youngest son Nicholas at The Ritz, with the 'mission' to also receive a till receipt at 11th. hour. 11th. minute. This was my second visit to The Ritz, with the first back in the 1980s when treated by a business companion, who needless to say, drove a Rolls Royce and had a three masted sloop based in Southam,pton, Hampshire. On that occasion the afternoon tea was extremely pleasant as was the business result for me. On the previous eveing I had attended a Masonic function at Stationer's Hal;l, near St. Pauls's, spent the night at a Holiday Inn near Chelsea. On arrival by taxi at The Ritz I gave my name at reception and a copy of my e-mail booking. On being seated at my reserved table I was then approasched by a manager who stated that tables were for reservations only. That I was already seated at my reserved table I took offence at his sharp comment. He apologised and departed. Eventually my pot of Darjeeeling tea was served. Sadly, it was little short of tepid, and almost cold. This for me was an amazing situation in a place such as The Ritz. my son arrived and I was dutifully presented with a till receipt stamped 11.11.11 - 11.00hrs. 11 mins. Tea was not exactly my son's choice, so we departed to the champagne bar. There, we sat and discussed family matters over quite a few glasses of champagne. I had brought my late uncle's ( George Henry Hamilton ) war medals, so we could taost his war contribution. He committed suicide having being discharged from the army on medical grounds. A sad event in my family history. The ambience in the champagne bar was fantastic and we outdrank most guests. The bill for the champagne came to £200. Afterwards Nicholas and I bought some souvenirs of The Ritz and took photographs. We departed to continue our family meeting in Soho. I did e-mail the Ritz manager and he apologised for the rare situation I had encountered and requested that I return so that he and I could have 'a chat'. I had tried to attend on St George's Day, 23rd. April, as The Ritz had a special menu for that day. But events prevented me from that day and meeting. I will return early summer, and hope to find the Darjeeeling pot of tea to be at least hot in The Ritz, which at 11.11. 11 proved not so ritzy. At the 11th. hour the Ritz staff lined up in front of the guests and paid a minutes silence in homage to our war fallen and veterans.

I completed a satisfaction survey and did not hear back so I then wrote to the hotel afterwards, I didn't get a response until I chased and then only had a response to my comments on the survey.

However, the staffs behaviour was inadequate for a hotel like this and the prices the guests have to pay.

However, the internet connection was as slow as a dial up connection and definitely is not worth 26 pounds per day that the hotel charges!I was amazed in a negative was from the breakfast time. The food was ok, although the buffet was very limited, but this was not the problem. There were like 10 people of the staff going around cleaning tables (because the time for breakfast had passed), people were washing the windows, and a guy was using an electric noisy vacum cleaner next to people trying to have their breakfast and have a nice time in this great breakfast room the ritz has. When I decided to leave and take my tea with me to my room one of the waiters said it was fine (although I do not know why would it not be fine to just take a cup of tea with me), but on my way out of the room another man of the staff told me I was not allowed to take my tea with me (!!!!!!!)Finally, the receptionist upon arrival took like 15 minutes for registering me as a second guest because my ID was not helpful for him, and also told me I should bring another identification next time as if he was doing me a favor or I was doing something wrong.I guess this could have been the best hotel ever IF the policy for the staff's behaviour was more appropriate for a 5 star hotel instead of behaving as if they work in a cheap 3 star hotel.", March 2012, Travelled as a couple

Our main course was halibut, moist and tender, panfried, with mushrooms, truffles and other vegetable delicacies. My guest then chose a rhubarb dessert, while I had a wondrously light pear souffle. In the years since I started coming here, I have never had a meal that was less than superb, and today there is an extra lightness and delicacy in the flavours and an even more polished presentation on the plate.

Wow! and the bath robes are fantastic! as are all the towels they provide. Many channels on the tv in the room which is great.

The skill of the service professionals at The Ritz is becoming a lost art.Down points: Having to wear a jacket and tie is an inconvenience (though they will kit you out if you need it). Prices of food and wine are astronomical (we spent more on room service than on the room... oops). The Ritz isn't designed for people my age (i'm in my mid twenties and sometimes the styling and ambiance is circa 1912). However, all of this added to its uniqueness and if, only once in your life, you have more money than sense... you shouldn't go anywhere else. Tip: Try the cigar lounge in the private members club. Secret entrance, perfect service, more trendy than the other meeting areas, a more homely feel, open all night, plays sports on tv and you can smoke indoors.", January 2012, Travelled with family

I wanted to stay very close to Buckingham Palace, and the main famous spots, so I decide for The Ritz. I expected the suite to be bigger, it seemed a simple room. Not many amenities in the bathroom (normally in 5 stars hotel it is possible to find toothbrush, shaving razor, etc, but we found only soap and shower gel., thank god I brought everything I needed). The restaurant was warm is atmospere, staff very well dressed, but easily to understand their english although they tried their best. Good food, but small qauntity. Nice lounge. Nice position as it was possible to reach any famous spot in few minutes. I suggest this hotel for those who have little to time to visit london.

The Ritz London is a gem for classic hotel lovers with  Louise XVI style decoration.. I have to admit that I find it hard to enjoy the style.. I was also a bit turned down with the patronising attitude that one feels at the hotel. I felt that I was in a special area with special rules at times. For example, I was meeting my friend staying at the same hotel for breakfast and I just wanted to have coffee. The welcoming lady first said that it is not possible to go in the restaurant if I was not going to have breakfast then allowed me to have coffee in as if she did a gracious favor. I read similar reviews and believe that The Ritz should learn that the best hotels are not arrogant as it used to be in 1970s.", January 2012, Travelled on business

Like the rest of the hotel it was classically and tastefully furnished but in an edwardian French chic style.As we were leaving early we didn't book breakfast, but I am sure it would have been special..I would return at Christmas and also book for afternoon tea..", December 2011, Travelled as a couple

Perfect food was served there, the hotel rooms had the comfy olden day feeling to them, which was a nice experience compared to the new modern world that we now live in. It was a fun and exciting experience and I would love to go there again. The thing that made it worthwhile was the atmosphere in the hotel. The dress when going to, and in the hotel was very formal which means no flip-flops!

Flaneuse1,35,53,A pleasant discovery and great way to finish our holiday,[5.0],"For New Years Eve, my partner and I had decided to spend it with family friends at the Marriott County Hall in London, as they offered a package where you could attend a gala dinner, followed by fireworks. This included staying there and checking out on the 2nd of January. As my partner and I had an extra day in London, we decided to enquire about another night at the Marriott - surprisingly, the rate they offered us was the same rate as New Years Eve (quite highly priced) and they didn't even budge to change it. Frustrated, my partner and I decided to check out and find elsewhere. Just for the sake of it, we had a look at the Ritz and discovered that they were offering a double room (with Queen sized bed) for a quarter of the price of what the Marriott offered and inclusive of internet access! We took it immediately and we never looked back. From the minute we arrived at the Ritz, the service was impeccable and full security was offered so we always felt safe. Every door opened and a smile and hello was received from everyone. Ben, at Reception, was incredibly helpful, giving us a full introductory tour of our hotel and room and attending to our every need! We even had the opportunity to book in for the famous high-tea at the Ritz at the last minute, when according to reception, you had to book two months in advance!

WorldYeye,20,33,Excellent Choice For an Elegant Experience,[5.0],"The Ritz London is, no doubt, an excellent choice for those looking to pamper themselves while in London.  Upon arriving to this beautiful English landmark, you receive unsurpassable service. You are welcomed by very attentive bellboys who, will try to help you all through your stay. The personnel at the front desk  is pleasant and  welcoming and pay close attention to detail; the building is, an architectural gem.  The Ritz does enforce a dress code in certain areas of the hotel, not if you are coming back from your day touristic activities, etc., of course.Food was not the best The Ritz had to offer.  As of service, I should say it was not up to the general standards. We had an unpleasant experience with a room service waiter, who expected quite a larger tip than what is customary or above (20%) and let it know by smashing the door upon leaving the room. However, I MUST say that when this was brought to the attention of the management, they responded professionally and offered us an apology, promising to review this event with their personnel. Concierge was helpful and very pleasant, they offered us a complimentary car to take us to a theatre at Piccadilly; the driver was very courteous too.The hotel is at a short walking distance from Mayfair, High Park, and Piccadilly Circus,  just across of beautiful Green Park. Green Park subway station is just steps away of the hotel, and many buses pass on Piccadilly Street: they would take you almost anywhere in downtown London. However, I must say that I found most bus routes quite confusing (don't expect drivers to be helpful).  Taxies are ready and available: London taxies offer one of the best services in the world.All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the London Ritz Hotel very much; I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to experience one of the best traditional hotels in the world.", February 2011, Travelled with family
simmie17,430,253,ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL STAY!!!!!,[5.0],"I have just returned from an 8 day stay with daughter over Xmas.  This also was for daughter's birthday, so I was looking for a very special experience.  I read all the reviews on TA for many hotels, and I am so glad in the end I chose the Ritz.  One of the main reasons I did was their affiliation with Leading Hotels of the World, a fabulous group.  As a member we got free continental breakfast (which cannot be compared to what we call a continental breakfast in the U.S.) and free internet, as well as a welcoming gift and early check in if available.  In addition, if there were any issues, I knew I could count on LHW to straighten it out.   We did arrive early and our suite overlooking Piccadilly St and Green Park was available.  What a relief!  A reservation manager escorted us to our room, and sent up coffee and tea.   Words cannot adequately describe how beautiful the suite was.  There was a separate bedroom and living room, set up with a sofa bed, though I did use a rollaway.  The bathroom was clean and spacious, and I loved the heated towel rack.  I personally loved the decor- we found it festive and warm.   The location of the room allowed us to watch the New Year's Parade from our room, as it overlooked the very start of the parade.  What a special experience!  Staff throughout our stay was pleasant and attentive.  We wanted the heat adjusted and that was done immediately.   The concierge staff (there were several) were all very helpful, and arranged for us to get tix to the sold out Da Vinci show at the National Gallery, a reservation at Helene Darroze, and booked a car for us from the airport and back from the best car service, Brown's,  ever. (Kudos to Graham, our driver arriving and departing- super nice guy who  gave us a mini tour upon arrival in London and helped us tremendously departing at the airport- request him if in London if you can).   We had room service breakfast each morning and the presentation was always excellent and more than we could eat.   We had the tea  New Year's Day for daughter's birthday-  prior to this we had had tea at the Plaza in NY a few months back, which was also lovely.  However, nothing can compare to the tea at the Ritz!   Again, fabulous service and food.  Sandwiches were replenished as needed- I have never seen this before.  I had arranged for a small cake.   It was a delightful experience. We ate in the Palm Court as well New Year's Eve.  It was fairly expensive but worth it.  The service and food were excellent, and at the end a marching band appeared and escorted us into the main dining room for a fireworks show.   One of the best New Year's ever!I also must commend the staff at the Rivoli Bar, especially Harry and Nicholas.   I was always treated beautifully. I loved sitting at the bar and ending the day with a glass of champagne.  One night we ordered the caviar- what a special treat!  We also had lunch one day in the Bar also, and the sandwiches were very good.  Yes, there is a dress code, but I think it adds to the ambiance in the hotel, and makes it more special.  Jeans can be worn in the bar anyhow.  I was able to see  the lobbies of several of the other hotels I had considered- the Dorchester and the Connaught - and I did not get the same warm, welcoming feeling that I got at the Ritz. Yes, there is extra  security too, but they were all nice guys and  I was glad they  were there.  The location was excellent-  near Bond St,  Regent St and taxis were always available. A Boots pharmacy is across the street.  The double-decker bus tours start down Piccadilly St, and there is an underground next to the hotel.  When it rained, the doormen were there to help you out of the taxi, holding an umbrella out for you.  I  can truly say the Ritz was the best part  of the trip.  We were treated like royalty.

Everyone was very nice but seemed a bit aimless and lacking direction.  Maybe the Manager was on holiday over the Christmas period.  A few examples - the young man whom we first met at reception was very friendly and charming.  Unfortunately the key to our room was missing.  We had to be escorted up to and let into the room and were told the key would be brought up.  We went down for afternoon tea and afterwards went back to reception.  The same young man seemed not to remember us at all or the fact that we were missing our room key.  Again we had to be escorted to our room by a member of staff and again we were told the key would be left up.  This didn't happen. When we called at reception again on our way out to the theatre we were told the hall porter had the key.  If so, why didn't someone bring it to us?  As it was we felt like naughty schoolchildren being escorted everywhere by a prefect.   Afternoon tea was very nice but not as good as Claridges.  Breakfast in the morning was fine but when we went down although the room was 70% empty we were asked to wait in the lobby until a table was prepared.  So all in all not the sort of service one would expect if paying almost £500 a night.  The decor is very lavish and OTT - definitely not for minamilists.

KathyRome,44,25,Very disappointing service,[2.0],"I am currently staying here, and I have to say the service here is a huge let down.  At this level of hotel, not to mention this price point, one would expect top notch service.  I have written several hotel reviews over the years, and this is my first negative review.  One example:  they charge 26 pounds per day for WiFi.  First off, what hotel still charges for WiFi in 2012 especially when the rooms are some of the most expensive in the world?  We asked the hotel if they would waive the fee and they flatly refused.  We told them that even the Dorchester has free WiFi and their response was that this has been their policy for years and they would not change it.  We calmly told them that this policy would likely result in us not returning, and they said that was fine and their policy is fixed.  Again, at this level of hotel, there should not be any ""fixed"" policy especially over such a simple issue.  The Ritz supposedly prides itself on service,  but we have had much more accomodating service at other high and mid-range hotels.  Also, another small issue is that there are no drawers and few hangers.  At another notel this would be fine, but this is The Ritz and we expected more.", December 2011, Travelled with family

The service was excellent.. Although I did not dine at their restaurant this time I have done so on many an occasion in the past and there is nothing to complain about.. However the afternoon tea at the palm court I must comment has become somewhat of a tourist attraction and hence many of those there are perhaps not entirely the crowd one sees staying at the hotel or dining at night..

I stayed in a Superior Queen room, which was very well equipped and decorated to a high standard, but wasn't the best room I've ever stayed in.  The bathroom was fabulous and quite large, with everything you could wish for.  The public areas of the hotel are truly magnificent and serve as a reminder of just how lavish a hotel can be without being over the top. However, what makes The Ritz stand well above the rest is the staff.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated with courtesy, respect and sincerity by every member of staff we came into contact with.  Everyone seemed to know our name - quite how they do that, I don't know, but it is a marvellous thing to witness.  It makes you feel very special.  The Ritz is not just a hotel, it's an experience, and one to be remembered fondly for many years.", October 2011, Travelled on business
Sindhwani,36,18,Hmm a Good Hotel!!,[4.0],"This was my first visit to The Ritz and I must say I was not disappointed. The check in was very friendly and quick and I was given a detailed tour of the room by the front desk staff, the rooms are nice but small in size specially the bathroom also they could put a little bigger TV’s in the room( at the moment its 26 inches). The service was top notch in all the areas (Restaurant, concierge & House Keeping), the break fast good but they can improve with putting for more choices on the menu.The pianist who is from Kolkata was great and you will really enjoy talking to him as he plays during the Hi-tea in the hotel, the internet is little expensive and also its little slow in terms of the speed.

It was more of a 'joke' in that we normally don't stay in very expensive hotels, and we felt we were there undercover :) we enjoyed fluffy robes, a lovely bathroom with all the freebies, and cool writing paper with the Ritz heading. The concierge was ok to keep our suitcase after we checked out which was important to us.On the minus side, the lock in our room was broken (was repaired on the spot) and we asked for the Guardian instead of the Daily Telegraph you normally get there. We didn't get the Guardian, and were a bit annoyed as we don't like the Telegraph, a right-wing paper. But these were minor.We also had a meal in the restaurant, and were amazed with the quality of the food. There was also an excellent pianist in the lobby whom we could hear. To finish our stay off, we had afternoon tea at the Ritz, and  there's nothing I can complain about there - it was fantastic and again, it's an experience in itself.

Great service and good location, but... when a hotel of this caliber and price charges 25 pounds per day for internet access, it bothers me. It's not quite cricket. Also, the food and room service offerings are good but not up to snuff in terms of what you expect in this category of hotel.

FYI, before going, be aware that jeans are not allowed in certain areas, especially in the evening. Also, there is a dress code that must be followed.

The concierge services are legendary, and we were always greeted by name when we entered the hotel.  Rooms were comfortable, and when they misplaced the key to one of our rooms did not get the key until 10:00 that evening, they did not charge me for the room. While staying at the Ritz was an experience I won't forget, I would be hesitant to recommend it to a family with children.  My biggest complaint is that you cannot enter the lobby or dining room unless you are dressed appropriately--no jeans, no ""trainers"" (sneakers), men/boys must have a collared shirt. After being there for 3 days and not going beyond the french doors separating the reception area from the lobby, (I was not going to check out of this legendary hotel without seeing the lobby!)I got my family ""dressed"" for breakfast--the dinning room is magnificent--then changed back into jeans and sneakers for a day of sightseeing.

We don't know if it was because we were celebrating our anniversary or that we told Andrew that we were going to compare the Ritz with the Savoy (we were staying at the Savoy the following night), but we were upgraded to a junior suite which was absolutely lovely. We had booked a picnic in the park package which I would highly recommend. Fortnum and Mason Hamper, champagne, strawberries, wine, great weather too in the Green Park which is adjacent to the hotel. We had dinner in the restaurant too and they know how to look after you, it was fantastic, the food, the service, the atmosphere, pianist, band, I could get used to this!! The head waiter John Williams was evident and we felt like royalty. As a guest of the Ritz, you can join the Ritz club next door which we did and played and won at Blackjack. The Club is Luxuriously appointed and everyone is really friendly, what a way to spend a few hours, Nostalgic bliss!! We overlaid in the morning missing breakfast, called down to reception and a very helpful chap suggested what I should have, It was one of the best breakfast experiences ever and arrived in the 20 minutes that he said it would. Around the hotel there are several security men who will ask to see your room card, I was aware of this from previous tripadvisor reviews and to be honest I felt re-assured that they were checking everyone.

We ordered a sandwich and tea from room service which was served promptly and came on a trolley that was also a table, complete with silver service....wonderful.   The cake and the flowers came home with us very carefully packaged for the journey by the staff.  The flowers lasted for 2 weeks and were a reminder of the wonderful time we had.  We also had ""Tea at The Ritz"" in Palm Court with absolutely impeccable service and (beware) seconds (and thirds) servings of sandwiches, cakes and tea were readily available if you had room.  The breakfasts were superb, the eggs cooked to perfection.  We would have had dinner but unfortunately the restaurant was fully booked until 9.30pm which is too late for us to eat especially as we were to have breakfast the next day, will have to do it next time! However we did eat from the menu in the Rivoli Bar which didn't disappoint, while also enjoying some delightful cocktails.  We finished off our stay with a visit to Buckingham Palace just a short walk away, so all in all we had a real Royal time as we felt we were treated like royalty by the lovely staff.We enjoyed it so much that everything else will now be second best and we will certainly be returning.", September 2011, Travelled as a couple

The service was impeccable throughout. We took dinner in the dining room which took three hours; it was like being in the middle of a wonderful cookery programme. a live band played and people got up for a dance. The ladies wore nice cocktail/evening dresses but most of the men wore lounge suits which was a surprise. We were given a complete vegetarian menu with choices which was a novel experience! The room was decorated in the style of Louis VIV, subtle arrangement of colours, very comfortable bed. There are no coffee/tea making facilities but I can see why, it just wouldn't fit in with the style of this hotel. A bose player sat on the fire place and could take CDs or iPOD. Security was discrete at the front door.We also took afternoon tea which takes place in a shifts every two hours in the palm court. it was an amazing experience. We sat down to a lovely table with a large tea menu to select your drink from, a tray of vegetarian sandwiches (beware, they offer you seconds!), a gap for the scones which arrive a little later warm and a top layer of little fancy cakes. We were also offered cut cake and many top ups of tea; i couldn't manage the last little cake as i feared I might explode.....The scones and jam & cream were lovely.the only down side of the whole event was that there are only one set of loos downstairs which are used by diners and tea drinking parties alike, the queue was enourmous and the queue jumping was very annoying. We ended the weekend with lunch and were attended to right in to the taxi waiting outside with all our bags loaded. My Husband said he is not waiting  another 25 years to return. He loved it.

The bill tends to get quite high in the end, but if you can afford it, why not? Another special occasion was the afternoon tea in the Palm Court.

The public areas are stunning, you can't say anything else, however there was plenty of chipped paint and worn areas around our room that were well overdue a touch-up. When you are operating at this level you simply can't have this  - you should not walk into a bedroom and think that a bit of filler or paint is required. It also makes you question cleanliness when the room is a bit scruffy. The staff were fantastic and the security, while evident, was not overbearing. The dress code is made clear on the website and by staff on check in and I guess if you don't like that sort of thing then this hotel is not for you. It's irritating when you make the effort to adhere to the dress code (no jeans or trainers in the public rooms) but others don't and nothing is said.

I then popped to see the concierge service and asked if they could do something to the room whilst we were out to surprise my fiance on our return. When we returned there were hundreds of white rose petals laid out across the bed in a heart shape with some chocolate covered strawberries on the side.

Duquesa1,15,27,"Well worth it for such a wonderful, memorable experience",[5.0],"My mum and I were visiting London for three nights and finally, instead of saying ""We should..."" We did! We went to The Ritz for dinner and what an experience it was. The surprise of it not looking much from the outside was soon a distant memory once we stepped inside.  It was like you would imagine the Titanic to have looked like. Beautiful curtains, plush carpets and sparkling chandeliers in a spotlessly clean and opulent yet friendly and inviting wonderland.The entire hotel is decorated in a wonderfully olde-England manner when things were grand and fantastic with luxurious, heavy curtain and thick carpets - a delightful change from modern minimalism where everything is white and lacking in any character whatsoever. The character of the Ritz oozes from every curtain tassel from the moment you walk through the revolving entrance door. The staff are charming and courteous, not at all surly and all speak impeccably. They are highly educated and trained and deserve the same respect that they bestow on their patrons.We were a bit early for our reservation as we got there faster than we thought we would, so went to the cocktail bar and indugled in a perhaps-too-pricey-but-worth-it Champagne cocktail each.  These were lovely and a definite luxury! Complimetary nibbles were presented in a pretty serving platter.When it was time, we went back to the restaruant and were greeted with charm and enthusiasm as we were led to the table which was also beautiful. The old, heavy silver condiment set and cutlery were lovely. There is a waiter for every purpose and they were all extremely well mannered and efficient. They introduced themselves, asked if we were enjoying ourselves and enquired if it was a special occasion (they bring a complimentary cake if it is someone's birthday and wrap it in a box to take home) as we saw with the table beside us!Our main waiter (tall, dark, and handsome with a fantastic accent, which is all you can ask for!) was charming, funny (with just the right amount of eye-twinkling charm but at the same time, not too familiar) and complimented me on my dress saying it matched the colour of the plates which had a lovely green edging. We chatted to him a couple of times about our stay in London and also about the lovely but not instrusive music being played by the trio in the corner of the room.We had an overall amazing experience and I would love to go there again. It was like a different world. We were treated like royalty and it was worth every penny for this one-off experience.Anyone complaining about the decor or ""musty"" smell might have been in a another wing of the hotel.  I saw another review by someone who also had a bad experience of London overall. It would not be fair to leave a bad review on such a wonderful place just because your overall stay was not enjoyable. I most certainly did not find the hotel dated or musty. It was splendid, down to the ladies' toilets which were bright, spotless and had hand creams, towels, etc.It was as experience that I would very much hope to repeat, maybe next time with my husband in tow.They do require that you dress appropriately and men must wear a jacket and tie but then you would make that extra effort to dine here. Some of the women could have made more effort considering the dress code required of gentlement.  I mean come on! you can easily eat budget in Chinatown or elsewhere and save your money for the rest of the stay but splashing out for one night here is well worth it if you can!The cost of tea and coffee is not included and you can expect to pay £6 for a bottle of mineral water for two and £14 for a glass of wine but the complimentary cold frothy palate refresher served before the meal and the far-too-tasty petits fours that come with your coffee really make up for it!  Ah I can still taste those macaroons, they were divine!Getting a taxi outside back to your hotel is very straight forward. If there are no taxis outside then just walk to the top of the street cross to the right and you will find or hail a black cab there in moments.Overall, a fabulous and memorable experience from start to finish!", August 2011, Travelled with family

jbulth39,42,27,Worth every penny,[5.0],"My wife and I stayed here for one day as we had one extra night on the tail end of a long trip to Europe. We decided to splurge and stay at the Ritz as we figured we would need it after a long trip. It was worth it. The service was impeccable as would be expected out of a hotel with the reputation that the Ritz has. Our phones had pretty much had their fill of European Wi-Fi by this time so the hotel promptly provided us with a laptop so we could finish up some last minute travel details and get up to speed with what was going on back at home before we flew back to Chicago. The concierge set us up with a fantastic restaurant, witch I'm sure would have sent us away if we just come looking for a table, for our last night in London. The building is beautiful and the rooms are extremely well appointed. The only two complaints are that like a lot of old hotels the plumbing is a little touchy so the shower was an experience but once you got the hang of it it was fine and the woman who showed us around when we first arrived forgot to tell us to leave our key at the bell desk when we went out and where the guest elevators were so we were somewhat confused when we left the first time. Minor stuff that pales in comparison with the rest of the hotel.One heads up, there is a dress code for the common areas of the hotel which they take VERY seriously so be forewarned that they will shoo anyone who is not in compliance right out the door.Don't get me wrong, the room was a lot of money, even for just one night but if you are looking to splurge on a real treat look no further.", April 2011, Travelled as a couple
BijouxButtercup,39,31,The Ritzy Was Too Ritzy For Me!,[4.0],"The Ritz is a lovely hotel. Really it is. The service is impeccable. I just returned from a 4 day stay at The Ritz. While it is a lovely hotel, I don't think I would ever stay there again. It just isn't for me. The reason is that the Ritz is so formal; too formal for me. At the end of a long day of sightseeing I would like to go to the bar and have a drink without needing to make a reservation. Furthermore, I'd like to have that drink without having to dress up so much. And this is the Ritz. Gentlemen must have a tie and coat on for all rooms in the hotel save for breakfast. If you like this type of formality, than the Ritz will send you over the moon. For me personally, it is too much. I've read other posts compalining about the security. Personally i was grateful. Considering the high profile target this hotel would make for terrorists in a a high profile city such as London, I don't think the security measures are too much. The first time we walked in we were asked why we were there. Once we said to check in it was fine. Others were walking in for the tea. The bottom line is that security means you are expected to have a purpose for being at the hotel. Once your purpose is known everyone is fine, even the inquiry is gracious. And, once a security person saw mye once, I was never asked again and was always greeted with a welcome back and my name.. I suppose you can take these measures as an affront or a comfort. I chose comfort. The room was elegant and well appointed. The turn down service includes a sealed, glass bottle of water by the bed side each night. The bathrooms are luxurious and the bed! That bed may be too soft for some, but I found it to be the most comfortable bed ever, with eiderdown pillows. I slept great. There is outside noise from the street even with the windows closed, but it didn't bother me and I'm pretty sensisitive to that stuff. As i said earlier you need reservations for the bar and be dressed appropriately. No jeans or sneakers permitted. It was a pain to me, but I will say the cocktails are superb! Expensive, but superb. We only drank at the bar one night. In the immediate area there are many pubs, bars and cafes. This hotel is so centrally located there is no need to feel slave to the facilities within. The concierge is more than helpful in making reservations. He was also able to get us into one restaurant that was already booked. Somehow he convinced them to fit us in. When we arrived a special table had been set up to accomodate us. All in all The Ritz is truly an amazing hotel and one which I know many dream of staying at and others would stay nowhere else.

As with all of Europe, it's showing its age (in good ways and bad.) I suspect Europeans have lower standards for cleanliness and wear. Where do I start?  BATHROOM -Spacious for Europe. Marble. Towel warmer seemed to leak natural gas. I stayed in two rooms and management didn't seem to think this was a problem. Don't smoke in the bathroom. BTw, who in Europe thinks that those glass partitions are superior to shower curtains. Slow drains.

OlympiaSteve,17,48,Rather disappointed,[3.0],"We spent our last night in London at The Ritz and admittedly booked it on a whim. So, we might not have been put in the best room on the best floor (we got room 226).   The hotel IS splendid as you walk through its immense, luxurious lobby. You really have to see it to appreciate it. And, the bell staff were quite attentive, pointing out every feature and amenity in our room. But, the room itself was a disappointment.  First, it was hot. And there was only one A/C vent - in a window sill on the far side of the room - laboring away rather unsuccessfully. Thankfully, the room had electric roll-down window shades and they helped. We also requested, and got, a small in-room air-conditioning unit that also helped. But even with that, the room was still too warm for my tastes. …", September 2009,nan
RhianSouthWales,10,1,fantastic stay!!!,[5.0],"I have just returned from a weekend break to celebrate my 40th birthday at the Ritz hotel.  We are a family of 4 with children aged 15 and 12 yrs.  I have to say that from the moment we got there this hotel had the wow factor! There was a card and a birthday cake in my room upon check in.  Everything was taken care of and the staff were wondefull.  Our package included a junior suite, breakfast and we also booked afternoon tea on the day of my birthday.  The room was lovely and the bathroom huge.  The breakfast was delighful with a delicious selection and is served in the ritz restaurant with all it's beautiful surroundings.  Afternoon tea was served in the palm court and again there was plenty of choice i highly recommed this for a special occasion.  Room service arrived exactly at the requested time but i have to mention the jewel of the Ritz  - Tony the concierge, he provided us with excellent tickets for a show  and also recommended and booked us a table at an excellent restaurant again at a moments notice, nothing was impossible or too much trouble for him.  Despite this being a 5 star hotel the children were welcomed which we have not always found in the past with this type of hotel, every night milk and cakes were left for them and all the staff went out of their way to speak to them.  We wanted to do some shopping on our last day so after we checked out we left our luggage in the hotel and they were placed in the car for us,  when we returned to the hotel the car was brought to the front with all our belongings ready to leave.  We really did have a fantastic 3 night stay here and cant wait to return.

JohnGalt330,57,58,Perfection,[5.0],"The Ritz London harkens back to an era of grace, manners, elegance, and unparalleled service that seems more often than not today to have all but vanished from our society.  I have been lucky enough to stay here a few times, and it remains my hotel of choice in London.  In my view, nobody comes close to doing hospitality like the Ritz.  The service is second to none; I don't know where they find their incredible staff or how they train them, but I have never stayed anywhere where the employees were so inviting, friendly, and constantly helpful in ways that go far beyond what is merely required.  In addition to being constantly good-natured, accommodating, and amiable, as one would hope for but so often doesn't find even at a hotel of this caliber, they went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant and memorable as possible.  They made nightly reservations for us at London's best restaurants, places we would never have gotten into on our own; on our way out when we stopped to ask for directions, they offered us the hotel's Rolls Royce free of charge to drop us off; the doormen even learned our names--not to mention remembered us from our earlier stay and made mention of it, despite the hundreds of new faces they must take in daily.  In the world of service at luxury hotels, the rest would do well to take notice of the way it is done at the Ritz.  The rooms are of course superb, flawlessly clean and lavishly elegant.  Our suite was as spacious as it was beautiful, with high ceilings and a simply amazing marble bathroom with a whirlpool tub and glass shower.  Housekeeping and room service were as beyond reproach as the rest of our experience at the Ritz, and I think I could very happily have given up my house to move into that lovely room.We arrived immediately following a stay at the George V in Paris, a hotel that is often described as perhaps the finest in the world; despite having a wonderful stay there, we found the Ritz far more charming.  Everything about it breathes gentility, from the beautiful decor to the strict dress code required in the Palm Court, bar, and restaurant.  I understand that this formality is not to everyone's taste, but it never ceases to amaze me how people will complain about it as though it were a fault of the hotel.  The sense of the elegance of a bygone era is one of the Ritz's distinguishing features, and if it isn't to one's liking, then the solution is simple--one ought not to stay here.  For my part, I find it refreshing in this world of torn jeans and endless informality; in its sophistication, its charm, its spectacular service, and yes, even its formality, the Ritz pays heed to the niceties of the past, and for that, there is nowhere in the world I would rather stay.", May 2006, Travelled with family

FinestLA,2,1,Simply the best!,[5.0],"My partner and I stayed at The Ritz in August for four nights. We had notified the hotel that we might be late in arriving since we would be on the Orient-Express from Venice and there was absolutely no problem when we arrived. We were assisted from the taxi and our luggage brought into the hotel and received a warm welcome from Reception, which upgraded our accommodation and then escorted us to our room. As we had to be at the Victoria Palace shortly thereafter, there was no time to drink the Champagne which awaited us, nor later since we dined at Sheekey's, quite the best seafood restaurant in London. The Champagne was kept for another night.Breakfast the following morning (and all others) was excellent, including the finest fresh raspberries I have ever had. The fresh orange juice left something to be desired - it certainly was freshly squeezed, but not as sweet as we are used to in California. Beautiful omelettes though and excellent service, if a little leisurely by American standards. However, we were not pressed for time except for one morning, and having mentioned this on arrival in the restaurant, the service was speeded up to allow us to eat rather more swiftly.The room itself was everything it should be - we did not have a suite, but compared to one at the Waldorf=Astoria Towers (New York) it was quite as acceptable. The beds were comfortable, the drapes let in no light and there were no noises from outside. Room service was prompt and the beds were always turned down before we returned. The bathroom was immaculate and had a separate door from the vestibule. The decor may not be to everyone's taste, but it matches everything else in the hotel in a grand luxe manner; it is in no way minimalist! The Hall Porter was always affable and helpful, although he did not actually believe we had a private tour of Buckingham Palace! Every time we arrived back, whether early or late, we were greeted by name and made to feel at home, which was greatly appreciated. I rather like the ""old fashioned"" keys and was pleased not to have a magnetic-striped card, which inevitably fail once or twice.On our last evening we dined in the Restaurant but, like so many contemporary establishments, found the offerings a little too clever, but probably appealing to younger 'foodies' since our taste is more for The Ivy and The Gay Hussar, the latter no longer fashionable. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the meal and then retired to our room to pack for the flight back to Los Angeles. Altogether a most enjoyable stay; whether we would stay there on a regular basis I can't say. Certainly it is most convenient, whether for walking, taking a taxi or the 'Tube'. But it certainly should be done once in a lifetime since very few of us actually live like that from day-to-day. Highly recommended!", August 2008, Travelled as a couple
HotelQueenBee,1,21,The Ultimate in Turn-Off Snobbery!!,[1.0],"I have to concur with the other reviewers who complained about the over zealous security at the Ritz. It boils down to one word:  snobbery. It was such a turn off that I'll never return. A friend and I stopped in to talk with the reservations desk to see about room availability for a later return to London (we were on a London - Rome - London itinerary).  We are attractive, professional looking people and were dressed very respectibly (not wearing jeans as per another reviewer's comments, not that I think there's anything wrong with that either). As soon as we entered and walked toward the front looking for the reservations area, the security man practically chased us down -- you would've thought we were criminals. It was incredibly embarrassing. He was ""politiely rude"", if you know what I mean. While very openly looking down his nose at us, he ushered us back toward the door and told us we would have to make our enquiries at the information desk by the exit. Okay, so if he'd been polite and not condescending I would've called him helpful, but that was not the case. My reason for arriving unannounced to make a reservation in person and for staying there was to do an incognito site inspection, as I'm a meeting and event planner and was considering the hotel for a major upcoming booking which would have brought them a nice chunk of revenue. I don't want my guests being treated like that, however, and it sealed the deal. My friend and I left and I never considered this hotel for another event since, nor would I. There are too many other good options available where my guests will be treated with dignity from the moment they walk in the door, as it should be. It is the hospitality industry, after all. Elegance and snobbery do not have to go hand-in-hand, in my years of travel and planning experience. You can do better than this.", February 2005, Travelled on business
AntwerpLondonlover,3,24,"Ritz Hotel London, don't go there,unless you're David Beckham.",[1.0],"I spend last weekend at the Ritz in London. What a disappointment ! Because I booked by phone, i didnt recieved an conformation with the dresscode from the hotel.  I was there to do some shopping at Old and New-Bondstreet.  Because i wear a suit all week, i was wearing a comfy darkblue jeans, lightblue shirt with a darkblue pullover and brown leather shoes.All from Prada. (doesn't matter,but to give you a picture..) If my name was David Beckham i wonder if it was a problem then..I was treated like a beatnik! I was checking in and asked if i could use the bathroom after an 5 hour trip. The answer was ""No, i'm sorry, you are not allowed wearing  jeans, and i wasn't allowed in the bar or have breakfast dressed like that!Every time i came in the hotel, security asked me who i was, if i could show them my key etc etc... EVERY time i came in!I travel all over the world, but i've never been more insulted in my life then there at the Ritz.Because i wasn't allowed to have high-tea at the Ritz, i wend to the Landmark hotel. They know how to tread their guests! Even wearing jeans! Wonderful hotel ,excellent service,great high-tea. So my advice is: go to the Landmark hotel, it's a little more expensive then the Ritz,but worth every penny!", August 2008, Travelled as a couple

ourview,13,81,Over zealous security,[1.0],"We returned to the Ritz after having stayed about eight years ago for Valantines day - it was a disaster and a huge disappointment then, but we had a letter from the Manager apologising and that we should contact him when we next wanted to stay. It was our anniversary and we wanted to stay at Clariges but The Gordon Ramsey Restaurant was full, so my huband booked us two nights at the Ritz instead, we booked a Romance package for one night and the theatre for the next.  The Romance package included a bottle of champagne in the room, flowers and dinner/dance in the restaurant to include a bottle of wine.  We were given a room upgrade and greeted by the Duty Manager, the room was large and decorated in rich silks, the bathroom was of a good size, all gold taps and marble, with classic bath, tiny separate shower cubicle and gorgeous Floris toiletries. The Ritz is in a fantastic location and is a beautiful hotel but I have given the Ritz only one star rating due to our disappointment again.  The trouble with world famous hotels is that they tend to have over zealous security and consider most people entering the hotel as sightseers or criminals.  Therefore it is extremely annoying to have security keep asking you if they can help you, whilst the rest of the six or eight staff stare at you.   We wanted a glass of champagne in the bar before dinner, so we asked for our restaurant order to be taken there.  Bar Staff were excellent, but it seemed to confuse the restaurant staff that we were in the bar and things did not go smoothly.  We selected from The Summer Menu which was included in our room rate along with a bottle of wine -  which we had to ask for - this made us feel slightly cheap.  The evening did not seem to flow as it should, we waited forever for our starter, there was no pre-starter or bread just awful soggy melba toast already on our table.  The band was playing, the room was beautiful but our meal was acceptable but not great, Perhaps it was due to the package we had booked.  Breakfast was really good, as of course, it should be.  When returning after shopping security pounced, then again when we came back from the theatre.  If the doorman can regognise guests why can't security, it was irritating and spoilt our trip. All in all the Ritz is, due to its fame, over-rated, service is fantastic but some staff are condesending, the dress code is nice for the restaurant and afternoon tea, but for guests wanting to use the bar is just ridiculous.  Yes of course the Ritz is 5 star deluxe but I would never stay here again and would select a hotel just as luxurious but more modern without the pomp.", July 2008, Travelled as a couple

The beds very comfortable and the room was in very good condition, (The breakfast was good too). It is in a very convenient location for shopping and sightseeing. it is close to the Burlington arcade, the Royal arcade, and Fortnum & Mason. When we arrived, we asked if they had any availability for tea the following day, we got reservations for tea the next day at 11:30.

londoner-wannabe,5,11,"Beautiful hotel, but level of service depends on who you are",[4.0],"Stayed at the Ritz for four days in July 2008.  The room was a good size for London, with beautiful antiques and antique-style furnishings, and all the modern conveniences you could want.  The major problem with the Ritz is that it is just too full of itself, and the level of service one receives depends on who you are.  When you walk in the door, you see an amazing number of employees, in at least three types of uniforms (I assume the uniform signified something).  They are clearly looking at you and mentally assessing whether you are (1) royalty from some country, (2) high government, (3) multi-billionaire, (4) someone else who has been allowed to stay in the hotel, (5) riff-raff who merely want to sightsee.  Since the Ritz still uses the old, heavy keys which must be left at the desk and the desk is near the door, people in category 5 are immediately obvious and are ejected.  The elevator is near the desk, so category 4 people are expected to go directly to the elevator.  There are closed French doors leading to the Grande Allee, off of which are the Palm Court (for afternoon tea), the restaurant, the bar, and several quiet areas for lounging.  Unless you have a reservation and are properly attired (jacket and tie for men after noon), the employee will not open the French doors.  Your only chance to get thru is at breakfast, before the dress code goes into effect.  But even the level of service for a category 4 person is not what you expect considering the prices.  Twice in four days I returned from the theatre to find that the maid had not yet been in the room for turndown service.  Therefore the choice was to put out the ""do not disturb"" sign and forego the turndown service, or sit in the room and wait to go to bed until the maid had been there.  True, she was there within 15 minutes each time, but at RItz rates, you expect turndown to be completed well before 10:00.  Also, when I asked the concierge for a London Walks brochure, I received the winter brochure (in July).  None of this would matter if the Ritz didn't charge what it does.  (For a contrast, see my review of four days at Claridge's on my return to London, where the staff treats everyone the same and provides superlative service without fail.)", July 2008, Travelled solo

YumYum2008,15,16,Great bed- confused staff,[4.0],"We came from the Four Seasons in Paris so this was a little disappointing. I think it has to do with the attitude of the traveler who enters- if you expect to love it, you will. It is lovely and the rooms are good sized with wonderful beds and pillows. But I have several pet peeves in hotels- first, the bathroom opens into the bedroom directly so if you get up at night, you must shine bright light (no night lights in the bath) into the face of your significant other. Also, there was MOLD in the bathroom around the tub and soap dish. There is no excuse for mold to grow in a 5 star bathroom! Housekeeping left the sprayer on in the tub, so when water was turned on for the first time, it sprayed the entire bathroom!  Also, at check in, NO ONE came to the curb to help us. We waited about 5 minutes on the curb (having walked from the tube) and no door man was there. We finally walked into the hotel and had to ask for help. They were apologetic, but well, it was a bad start. The young woman who checked us in at the front desk said we didn't get breakfast in our plan, though it said so on our sheet, so we couldn't ask again until the next day AFTER breakfast was over  as to why we didn't get it- and the next day the other clerk said, oh yes- you DO. SO they made about 60 pounds off of us by denying us breakfast the first day. The bed was very comfortable, but we were out of sorts from travelling and having things go wrong. So, be sure you bring a nightlight or small flashlight if you get up in the night and don't want to disturb your partner, and ask for a different clerk if you think yours is wrong. We should have asked for our 60 pounds (the price of breakfast for 2) refund. Also, I agree with the commenter who said they were stuffy- I agree that in this day and age, it is silly for the staff to be standoffish to the customer. One can be professional and still be friendly. The staff at the Four Seasons in Paris proves that. Maybe they think you expect this  as part of the British experience? But, it is still the Ritz. So if you want to say you were there, you'll at least get a great bed!", June 2008,nan

If you just want to stay in your room its fine but there is a dress code and one is not allowed  to walk past the foyer in jeans.  We were waiting to meet up with someone and asked to sit in the small  foyer that is not at all  comfortable.  The breakfast was of a poor standard and the coffee cold and terrible, we did ask for hot milk but didn't get it.

Bathroom- shower spray hose was broken and it did not just happen. Towels were large but rough like sand paper.  Room service was poor.  What most amazed me was just the lack of hospitality.  The front desk manager did move me from one Jr. Suite to another and seemed to realize that there was a problem. She had a good attitude.  Rooms are worn and need to be painted and the fabric on furniture is worn. Yes the gold on the ceilings is beautiful but you need to take care of basics.  I did write to the GM of the hotel to share my opinion. …, June 2005,nan
Lindylu_007,38,32,"Good, but could be better",[4.0],"We received a voucher for the Ritz Finale package as a present - this package included accommodation in a superior room, 2 theatre tickets of choice, either pre or post theatre dinner menu and breakfast the next day.  The bedroom we were in was lovely although smaller than expected and expect to pay for everything - even tea/coffee as there's no tea/coffee facilities in the room.  Being a light sleeper however, I could hear all the traffic noise at night so soundproofing isn't the best.  We found most of the staff extremely polite and helpful although the concierge at the enquiry desk gave us wrong directions to the theatre (it was only 15 mins walk away) and so we were franctically trying to find it before the show started.  I would have expected to get the correct directions…", June 2005,nan

As frequent Guests of the Ritz Carlton , we couldn't wait to see this UK gem.  Boy--were we shocked at the greeting we received.  We entered the Lobby area and were rudely spoken to by someone (apparently worked the Lobby area) and asked ""May I help you""?.  We explained that we were past guests of the Ritz Carlton and wanted to view the Lobby and restaurant and perhaps reserve Tea--- he scolded back at us replying that this Ritz has nothing to do with Ritz Carlton and any further questions were to be directed to the reception area (off on the side of the Lobby).

The trip invovled entertaining guests, so made a booking at the Ritz.  Obviously, anyone visiting the Ritz for the 1st time is excited, but I decided to take my mother along for the trip.  The Ritz, according to previous reviews may not welcome visitiors.  I welcome this wholeheartedly.  The staff at the hotel have only one desire - the thorough well being of the guests staying at the hotel.  They are proud of being the most secure hotel in the world, and this is evident everywhere you look.  We stayed in a lovely suite overlooking Green Park, Buckingham Palace and Picadilly.

I spend about 30 nights per year away from home and have stayed at many wonderful hotels, so I do regard myself as therfore being capable of an unbiased review.  The public areas of this hotel are, absolutely superb, the lobby is gorgeous and very old world, the Rivoli bar is very elegant and almost over the top but the walnut wall paneling with inlaid Lalique crystal is superb and definately worth going to have a drink.  There is a high level of formality here at the hotel which means that to enter the bars and restaurants you will require a jacket, some people find this a bit too stuffy however I think it helps to create a very nice atmosphere.  i have also had dinner here in the…", December 2004,nan
travellingcat79,246,117,bargain!,[5.0],"My trip to the Ritz was a bargain. It was free! I won a trip for breakfast at the Ritz (including a nights stay) for four people. It was fantastic. The building was just how I pictured it to be decorated, and the bedrooms were fantastic. The staff were very helpful and didn't seem to be any more polite to the rich people than us!!  Breakfast was a bit intimidating, everyone oozed money from every pore (except me), then to make matters worse I spilt something and left a big stain on the tablecloth. The food was beautiful though, smoked salmon, scrambled egg, fresh berries etc  Overall, a great experience. I will never forget eating room service, lounging in my ritz bathrobe and slippers, a real treat!! ",nan,nan

I was travelling with my wife and two daughter (ages 13 and 12) and the staff really went out of their way to accomodate us.  Upon arrival I was immediately upgraded to a Junior Suite (because of Amex Platinum) and was allowed to check in at 9.00 am. The room was very large (approx 500 sqft) and the bathrooms were marvelous. Even though the room was quite pricey (340GBP approx $700) it was well worth it, at least for a once in a lifetime experience. The location is perfect with plenty of nice ethnic restaurants around, and the walks in Green Park were wonderful. The staff was excellent, and very courteous. I highly recommend it!!",nan,nan
fdipace,153,247,This hotel is no Alvear Palace or Principe Di Savoia hotel,[3.0],"I spent last night at the Ritz and was suprised to read all the glowing reviews on tripadvisor.  As a connoisseur of 5 star hotels this hotel is average at best.  Pros:  All standard 5 star ammenities, excellent location, helpful staff, marbel baths.  Neg's:  Small hotel elevator is poorly located within the bar/dining area, especially annoying if high tea is being served.  The rooms are decorated in a poorly executed Victorian decor (they appear to be decorated in the mid 50's, the only thing missing is plastic sofa covers).  The room I had was on the compact side for the price they charge, the carpet was worn but not as worn as the old robes supplied in the bathroom.

We arrived for afternoon tea which was like a cattle market, lots of people pushing and shoving to the front, there was no queue system, and lines of people trying to check their coats.  The tea was nice but it all seemed too mechanical, the waiters, although friendly, looked like bored and worn out robots.  I suppose everyone should try it once even thought it is an expensive tourist trap.  Our room was very nice, clean and lots of room and really comfy beds.

Everything is 5 Star from the location, historic building, greetings, check-in, service, top-notch security and food.  This property has held it together very well given the age and standard offered at other 5 star properties in Mayfair, St. James of the West End.  The Ritz London offers the #1 afternoon tea service in the UK - something one must experience at least once in a lifetime.  How can you resist those cucumber and smoke salmon sandwiches anyway?

A Tripadvisor Member,130,242,Well Earned Reputation,[5.0],"The Ritz has a strong reputation amongst London's finest and it is one well earned.  We checked in after longer than expected flights and were certainly not dressed as we might normally be.  Upon check in, we were welcomed and the clerk took us to a beautiful room, complete with plush bathrobes, fireplace and park views.  What was most impressive is how the staff made us feel welcome as if visiting an old friend's home.  They even brought us a bucket of ice for a bottle of champagne we picked up in transit without being asked and were service oriented without being overbearing.  As compared to other Four Seasons, the Ritz London is most certainly a cut above and well worth the price if only for a night or two. ", January 2005,nan

Of course, it is hard to justify such inflated prices even for such imposing architecture, magnificent decor, elegant furnishings, world-class service as well as more than a dash of olde English pomp and ceremony.

The room was a junior suite discounted at Â£470 for the one night (I'd recently stayed at the Ritz Madrid in a superior room for about Â£140.) It had an acre of luxurious carpet, gorgeous swagged curtains - and some elegant Regency furniture which was however too undersized to be of any real comfort - typical of the furniture (and decor) throughout the hotel.

They take tremendous trouble and make a huge effort to make sure everything is perfect, and it is only right that patrons copy that effort.

If you are there on business, no problem, but if you are there for pleasure, it is not relaxing to have to feel you need to dress up a bit all the time. The conceige, Michael, is GREAT. All we needed he obtained for us and in the best quality and location, etc. We could never have arranged for ourselves the same quality of theatre tickets, dinner reservations, etc. Rooms are very good and some quite spacious.
