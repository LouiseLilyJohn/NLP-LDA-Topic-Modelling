# Tripadvisor_reviews
Dataset was extracted from Tripadvisor for the Ritz Hotel London using python. 
The dataset consists of the profile name, number of profile contributions, number of helpful votes, review title, reviews, date of stay and trip category. There are over 4000 reviews extracted. 

I performed some data analyses on the reviews and LDA topic modelling on the reviews to understand what the main concerns and most positive things customers had to say about the hotel. I extracted two main topics through LDA topic modelling and visualised all the customer reviews using Word Cloud.
